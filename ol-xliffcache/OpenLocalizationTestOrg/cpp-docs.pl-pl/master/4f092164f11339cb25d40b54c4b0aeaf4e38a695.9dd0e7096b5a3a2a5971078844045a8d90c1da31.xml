A compound statement can be used anywhere a statement is expected. Compound statements are commonly called \"blocks.\"  \n  \n## Syntax  \n  \n```  \n  \n{ [ statement-list ] }  \n```  \n  \n## Remarks  \n The following example uses a compound statement as the *statement* part of the **if** statement (see [The if Statement](../cpp/if-else-statement-cpp.md) for details about the syntax):  \n  \n```  \nif( Amount > 100 )  \n{  \n    cout << \"Amount was too large to handle\\n\";  \n    Alert();  \n}  \nelse  \n    Balance -= Amount;  \n```  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  Because a declaration is a statement, a declaration can be one of the statements in the *statement-list*. As a result, names declared inside a compound statement, but not explicitly declared as static, have local scope and (for objects) lifetime. See [Scope](../cpp/scope-visual-cpp.md) for details about treatment of names with local scope.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Overview of C++ Statements](../cpp/overview-of-cpp-statements.md)"}
