For a modal dialog box, this occurs during the `DoModal` call. For a modeless dialog box, `OnInitDialog` is called when **Create** is called. You typically override `OnInitDialog` to initialize the dialog box's controls, such as setting the initial text of an edit box. You must call the `OnInitDialog` member function of the base class, `CDialog`, from your `OnInitDialog` override.  \n  \n If you want to set your dialog box's background color (and that of all other dialog boxes in your application), see [Setting the Dialog Box's Background Color](../mfc/setting-the-dialog-boxs-background-color.md).  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Life Cycle of a Dialog Box](../mfc/life-cycle-of-a-dialog-box.md)\n\n"}
