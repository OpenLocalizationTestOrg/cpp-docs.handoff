It is a rectangle that is gradually filled with the system highlight color as the operation progresses.  \n  \n The progress control is represented in MFC by class [CProgressCtrl](../mfc/reference/cprogressctrl-class.md).  \n  \n When you initially create the progress control, you specify its size and position, parent window (usually a dialog box), and ID. By using the `dwStyle` parameter, you can also specify various window styles for the control and styles for how it fills.  \n  \n## What do you want to know more about  \n  \n-   [Styles for the Progress Control](../mfc/styles-for-the-progress-control.md)  \n  \n-   [Settings for the Progress Control](../mfc/settings-for-the-progress-control.md)  \n  \n-   [Manipulating the Progress Control](../mfc/manipulating-the-progress-control.md)  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Controls](../mfc/controls-mfc.md)\n\n"}
