Extensions in an inference rule match a single target and dependent that have the same base name. Inference rules are user-defined or predefined; predefined rules can be redefined.  \n  \n If an out-of-date dependency has no commands, and if [.SUFFIXES](../build/dot-directives.md) contains the dependent's extension, NMAKE uses a rule whose extensions match the target and an existing file in the current or specified directory. If more than one rule matches existing files, the **.SUFFIXES** list determines which to use; list priority descends from left to right. If a dependent file does not exist and is not listed as a target in another description block, an inference rule can create the missing dependent from another file with the same base name. If a description block's target has no dependents or commands, an inference rule can update the target. Inference rules can build a command-line target even if no description block exists. NMAKE may invoke a rule for an inferred dependent even if an explicit dependent is specified.  \n  \n## What do you want to know more about?  \n [Defining a rule](../build/defining-a-rule.md)  \n  \n [Batch-mode rules](../build/batch-mode-rules.md)  \n  \n [Predefined rules](../build/predefined-rules.md)  \n  \n [Inferred dependents and rules](../build/inferred-dependents-and-rules.md)  \n  \n [Precedence in inference rules](../build/precedence-in-inference-rules.md)  \n  \n## See Also  \n [NMAKE Reference](../build/nmake-reference.md)"}
