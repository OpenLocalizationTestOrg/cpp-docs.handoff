A target must be at the start of the line. Separate targets from dependents by a colon (:); spaces or tabs are allowed. To split the line, use a backslash (\\ ) after a target or dependent. If a target does not exist, has an earlier timestamp than a dependent, or is a [pseudotarget](../build/pseudotargets.md), NMAKE executes the commands. If a dependent is a target elsewhere and does not exist or is out-of-date with respect to its own dependents, NMAKE updates the dependent before updating the current dependency.  \n  \n## What do you want to know more about?  \n [Targets](../build/targets.md)  \n  \n [Dependents](../build/dependents.md)  \n  \n## See Also  \n [NMAKE Reference](../build/nmake-reference.md)"}
