To use the MFC Application Wizard-supplied document class, you must do the following:  \n  \n-   Derive a class from **CDocument** for each type of document.  \n  \n-   Add member variables to store each document's data.  \n  \n-   Override **CDocument**'s `Serialize` member function in your document class. `Serialize` writes and reads the document's data to and from disk.  \n  \n## Other Document Functions Often Overridden  \n You may also want to override other **CDocument** member functions. In particular, you will often need to override [OnNewDocument](../mfc/reference/cdocument-class.md#cdocument__onnewdocument) and [OnOpenDocument](../mfc/reference/cdocument-class.md#cdocument__onopendocument) to initialize the document's data members and [DeleteContents](../mfc/reference/cdocument-class.md#cdocument__deletecontents) to destroy dynamically allocated data. For information about overridable members, see class [CDocument](../mfc/reference/cdocument-class.md) in the *MFC Reference*.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Using Documents](../mfc/using-documents.md)\n\n"}
