\n## Remarks  \n Each standard *asynchronous provider* returns an object whose type is an instantiation of this template. A `future` object provides the only access to the asynchronous provider that it is associated with. If you need multiple asynchronous return objects that are associated with the same asynchronous provider, copy the `future` object to a [shared_future](../standard-library/shared-future-class.md) object.  \n  \n## Members  \n  \n### Public Constructors  \n  \n|Name|Description|  \n|----------|-----------------|  \n|[future::future Constructor](#future__future_constructor)|Constructs a `future` object.|  \n  \n### Public Methods  \n  \n|Name|Description|  \n|----------|-----------------|  \n|[future::get](#future__get_method)|Retrieves the result that is stored in the associated asynchronous state.|  \n|[future::share](#future__share_method)|Converts the object to a `shared_future`.|  \n|[future::valid](#future__valid_method)|Specifies whether the object is not empty.|  \n|[future::wait](#future__wait_method)|Blocks the current thread until the associated asynchronous state is ready.|  \n|[future::wait_for](#future__wait_for_method)|Blocks until the associated asynchronous state is ready or until the specified time has elapsed.|  \n|[future::wait_until](#future__wait_until_method)|Blocks until the associated asynchronous state is ready or until a specified point in time.|  \n  \n### Public Operators  \n  \n|Name|Description|  \n|----------|-----------------|  \n|[future::operator=](#future__operator_eq)|Transfers the associated asynchronous state from a specified object.|  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Header:** future  \n  \n **Namespace:** std  \n  \n##  <a name=\"future__future_constructor\"></a>  future::future Constructor  \n Constructs a `future` object.  \n  \n```\nfuture() noexcept;\nfuture(future&& Other) noexcept;\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `Other`  \n A `future` object.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The first constructor constructs a `future` object that has no associated asynchronous state.  \n  \n The second constructor constructs a `future` object and transfers the associated asynchronous state from `Other`. `Other` no longer has an associated asynchronous state.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"future__get_method\"></a>  future::get  \n Retrieves the result that is stored in the associated asynchronous state.  \n  \n```\nTy get();\n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n If the result is an exception, the method rethrows it.
