The lines are useful for editing the image, but are not saved as part of the image itself.  \n  \n **Pixel grid**  \n When checked, displays a grid around each pixel in the Image editor. The grid appears only at 4× and higher resolutions.  \n  \n **Tile grid**  \n When selected, displays a grid around blocks of pixels in the Image editor, specified by the grid spacing values.  \n  \n **Width**  \n Specifies the width of each tile block. This is useful when drawing bitmaps containing multiple images that are arranged at regular intervals.  \n  \n **Height**  \n Specifies the height of each tile block. This is useful when drawing bitmaps containing multiple images that are arranged at regular intervals.  \n  \n## Requirements  \n None  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Resizing an Image](../mfc/resizing-an-image-image-editor-for-icons.md)   \n [Image Editor for Icons](../mfc/image-editor-for-icons.md)\n\n"}
