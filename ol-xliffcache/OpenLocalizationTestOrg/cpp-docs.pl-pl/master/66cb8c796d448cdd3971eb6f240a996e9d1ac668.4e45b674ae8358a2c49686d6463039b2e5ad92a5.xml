Component Object Model (COM) objects. It has special support for key COM features, including stock implementations, dual interfaces, standard COM enumerator interfaces, connection points, tear-off interfaces, and ActiveX controls.  \n  \n If you do a lot of ATL programming, you will want to learn more about attributes, a new feature in Visual C++ .NET that is designed to simplify COM programming. For more information, see [Attributed Programming](../windows/attributed-programming-concepts.md).  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [ATL Tutorial](../atl/active-template-library-atl-tutorial.md)  \n Leads you through the creation of a control and demonstrates some ATL fundamentals in the process.  \n  \n [Introduction to COM and ATL](../atl/introduction-to-com-and-atl.md)  \n Introduces the major concepts behind the Component Object Model (COM). This article also briefly explains what ATL is and when you should use it.  \n  \n [Fundamentals of ATL COM Objects](../atl/fundamentals-of-atl-com-objects.md)  \n Discusses the relationship among various ATL classes and how those classes are implemented.  \n  \n [Dual Interfaces and ATL](../atl/dual-interfaces-and-atl.md)  \n Describes dual interfaces from an ATL perspective.  \n  \n [ATL Collections and Enumerators](../atl/atl-collections-and-enumerators.md)  \n Describes the implementation and creation of collections and enumerators in ATL.  \n  \n [Composite Control Fundamentals](../atl/atl-composite-control-fundamentals.md)  \n Provides step-by-step instructions for creating a composite control. A composite control is a type of ActiveX control that can contain other ActiveX controls or Windows controls.  \n  \n [ATL Control Containment FAQ](../atl/atl-control-containment-faq.md)  \n Covers the fundamental questions related to hosting controls with ATL.  \n  \n [ATL COM Property Pages](../atl/atl-com-property-pages.md)  \n Shows you how to specify and implement COM property pages.  \n  \n [ATL Support for DHTML Controls](../atl/atl-support-for-dhtml-controls.md)  \n Provides step-by-step instructions for creating a DHTML control.  \n  \n [ATL Connection Points](../atl/atl-connection-points.md)  \n Explains what connection points are and how ATL implements them.  \n  \n [Event Handling and ATL](../atl/event-handling-and-atl.md)  \n Describes the steps that you need to take to handle COM events using ATL's [IDispEventImpl](../atl/reference/idispeventimpl-class.md) and [IDispEventSimpleImpl](../atl/reference/idispeventsimpleimpl-class.md) classes.  \n  \n [ATL and the Free Threaded Marshaler](../atl/atl-and-the-free-threaded-marshaler.md)  \n Provides details on the ATL Simple Object Wizard's option that allows your class to aggregate the free threaded marshaler (FTM).  \n  \n [Specifying the Project's Threading Model](../atl/specifying-the-threading-model-for-a-project-atl.md)  \n Describes the macros that are available to control run-time performance related to threading in your project.  \n  \n [ATL Module Classes](../atl/atl-module-classes.md)  \n Discusses the module classes new for ATL 7.0. Module classes implement the basic functionality required by ATL.  \n  \n [ATL Services](../atl/atl-services.md)  \n Covers the series of events that occur when a service is implemented. Also talks about some of the concepts related to developing a service.  \n  \n [ATL Window Classes](../atl/atl-window-classes.md)  \n Describes how to create, superclass, and subclass windows in ATL. The ATL window classes are not COM classes.  \n  \n [ATL Collection Classes](../atl/atl-collection-classes.md)  \n Describes how to use arrays and maps in ATL.  \n  \n [The ATL Registry Component (Registrar)](../atl/atl-registry-component-registrar.md)  \n Discusses ATL scripting syntax and replaceable parameters. It also explains how to set up a static link to the Registrar.  \n  \n [Programming with ATL and C Run-Time Code](../atl/programming-with-atl-and-c-run-time-code.md)  \n Discusses the benefits of linking statically or dynamically to the C Run-Time Library (CRT).  \n  \n [Programming with CComBSTR](../atl/programming-with-ccombstr-atl.md)  \n Discusses several situations that require caution when programming with `CComBSTR`.  \n  \n [Encoding Reference](../atl/atl-encoding-reference.md)  \n Provides functions and macros that support encoding in a range of common Internet standards such as uuencode, hexadecimal, and UTF8 in atlenc.h.  \n  \n [Utilities Reference](../atl/atl-utilities-reference.md)  \n Provides code for manipulating paths and URLs in the form of [CPathT](../atl/reference/cpatht-class.md) and [CUrl](../atl/reference/curl-class.md). A thread pool, [CThreadPool](../atl/reference/cthreadpool-class.md), can be used in your own applications. This code can be found in atlpath.h and atlutil.h.  \n  \n## Related Sections  \n [ATL Samples](../visual-cpp-samples.md)  \n Provides descriptions of and links to the ATL sample programs.  \n  \n [Creating an ATL Project](../atl/reference/creating-an-atl-project.md)  \n Contains information on the ATL Project Wizard.  \n  \n [ATL Control Wizard](../atl/reference/atl-control-wizard.md)  \n Discusses how to add classes.  \n  \n [Attributed Programming](../windows/attributed-programming-concepts.md)  \n Provides an overview on using attributes to simplify COM programming plus a list of links to more detailed topics.  \n  \n [ATL Class Overview](../atl/atl-class-overview.md)  \n Provides reference information and links to the ATL classes.\n\n"}
