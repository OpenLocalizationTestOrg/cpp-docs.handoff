This option allows you to disable support for certain new language and library features that may break your existing code that conforms to a particular version of the language standard. By default, **/std:c++14** is specified, which disables language and standard library features found in later versions of the C++ language standard. To explicitly enable the latest supported compiler and standard library features, use **/std:c++latest**.  \n  \n The default **/std:c++14** option enables the set of C++14 features implemented by the Visual C++ compiler. This option disables compiler and standard library support for features that are changed or new in more recent versions of the language standard, with the exception of some C++17 features already implemented in previous releases of the Visual C++ compiler. To avoid breaking changes for users who have already taken dependencies on the features available as of Visual Studio 2015 Update 2, these features remain enabled when the **/std:c++14** option is specified:  \n  \n-   [Rules for auto with braced-init-lists](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n3922.html)  \n  \n-   [typename in template template-parameters](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n4051.html)  \n  \n-   [Removing trigraphs](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n4086.html)  \n  \n-   [Attributes for namespaces and enumerators](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n4266.html)  \n  \n-   [u8 character literals](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n4267.html)  \n  \n The **/std:c++latest** option enables the set of C++ language and library features implemented by Visual C++ to track the most recent Working Draft and defect updates of the C++ Standard.
