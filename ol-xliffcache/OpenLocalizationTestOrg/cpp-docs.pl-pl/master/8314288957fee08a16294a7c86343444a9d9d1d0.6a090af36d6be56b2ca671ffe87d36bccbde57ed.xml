[CView](../../mfc/reference/cview-class.md), but it can be any [CWnd](../../mfc/reference/cwnd-class.md) object that has the appropriate child window ID.  \n  \n A `CSplitterWnd` object is usually embedded in a parent [CFrameWnd](../../mfc/reference/cframewnd-class.md) or [CMDIChildWnd](../../mfc/reference/cmdichildwnd-class.md) object. Create a `CSplitterWnd` object using the following steps:  \n  \n1.  Embed a `CSplitterWnd` member variable in the parent frame.  \n  \n2.  Override the parent frame's [CFrameWnd::OnCreateClient](../../mfc/reference/cframewnd-class.md#cframewnd__oncreateclient) member function.  \n  \n3.  From within the overridden `OnCreateClient`, call the [Create](#csplitterwnd__create) or [CreateStatic](#csplitterwnd__createstatic) member function of `CSplitterWnd`.  \n  \n Call the **Create** member function to create a dynamic splitter window. A dynamic splitter window typically is used to create and scroll a number of individual panes, or views, of the same document. The framework automatically creates an initial pane for the splitter; then the framework creates, resizes, and disposes of additional panes as the user operates the splitter window's controls.  \n  \n When you call **Create**, you specify a minimum row height and column width that determine when the panes are too small to be fully displayed. After you call **Create**, you can adjust these minimums by calling the [SetColumnInfo](#csplitterwnd__setcolumninfo) and [SetRowInfo](#csplitterwnd__setrowinfo) member functions.  \n  \n Also use the `SetColumnInfo` and `SetRowInfo` member functions to set an \"ideal\" width for a column and \"ideal\" height for a row. When the framework displays a splitter window, it first displays the parent frame, then the splitter window. The framework then lays out the panes in columns and rows according to their ideal dimensions, working from the upper-left to the lower-right corner of the splitter window's client area.  \n  \n All panes in a dynamic splitter window must be of the same class. Familiar applications that support dynamic splitter windows include Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel.  \n  \n Use the `CreateStatic` member function to create a static splitter window. The user can change only the size of the panes in a static splitter window, not their number or order.  \n  \n You must specifically create all the static splitter's panes when you create the static splitter. Make sure you create all the panes before the parent frame's `OnCreateClient` member function returns, or the framework will not display the window correctly.  \n  \n The `CreateStatic` member function automatically initializes a static splitter with a minimum row height and column width of 0. After you call **Create**, adjust these minimums by calling the [SetColumnInfo](#csplitterwnd__setcolumninfo) and [SetRowInfo](#csplitterwnd__setrowinfo) member functions. Also use `SetColumnInfo` and `SetRowInfo` after you call `CreateStatic` to indicate desired ideal pane dimensions.  \n  \n The individual panes of a static splitter often belong to different classes. For examples of static splitter windows, see the graphics editor and the Windows File Manager.  \n  \n A splitter window supports special scroll bars (apart from the scroll bars that panes may have). These scroll bars are children of the `CSplitterWnd` object and are shared with the panes.  \n  \n You create these special scroll bars when you create the splitter window. For example, a `CSplitterWnd` that has one row, two columns, and the **WS_VSCROLL** style will display a vertical scroll bar that is shared by the two panes. When the user moves the scroll bar, `WM_VSCROLL` messages are sent to both panes. When the panes set the scroll-bar position, the shared scroll bar is set.  \n  \n For further information on splitter windows, see:  \n  \n- [Technical Note 29](../../mfc/tn029-splitter-windows.md)  \n  \n-   Knowledge Base article Q262024: HOWTO: Use CPropertySheet as a Child of CSplitterWnd  \n  \n For more information on how to create dynamic splitter windows, see:  \n  \n-   MFC sample [Scribble](../../visual-cpp-samples.md)  \n  \n-   MFC sample [VIEWEX](../../visual-cpp-samples.md).  \n  \n## Inheritance Hierarchy  \n [CObject](../../mfc/reference/cobject-class.md)  \n  \n [CCmdTarget](../../mfc/reference/ccmdtarget-class.md)  \n  \n [CWnd](../../mfc/reference/cwnd-class.md)  \n  \n `CSplitterWnd`  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Header:** afxext.h  \n  \n##  <a name=\"csplitterwnd__activatenext\"></a>  CSplitterWnd::ActivateNext  \n Called by the framework to perform the Next Pane or Previous Pane command.  \n  \n```  \nvirtual void ActivateNext(BOOL bPrev = FALSE);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `bPrev`  \n Indicates which window to activate. **TRUE** for previous; **FALSE** for next.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n This member function is a high level command that is used by the [CView](../../mfc/reference/cview-class.md) class to delegate to the `CSplitterWnd` implementation.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"csplitterwnd__canactivatenext\"></a>  CSplitterWnd::CanActivateNext  \n Called by the framework to check to see if the Next Pane or Previous Pane command is currently possible.  \n  \n```  \nvirtual BOOL CanActivateNext(BOOL bPrev = FALSE);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `bPrev`  \n Indicates which window to activate. **TRUE** for previous; **FALSE** for next.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Nonzero if successful; otherwise 0.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n This member function is a high level command that is used by the [CView](../../mfc/reference/cview-class.md) class to delegate to the `CSplitterWnd` implementation.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"csplitterwnd__create\"></a>  CSplitterWnd::Create  \n To create a dynamic splitter window, call the **Create** member function.  \n  \n```  \nvirtual BOOL Create(\n    CWnd* pParentWnd,  \n    int nMaxRows,  \n    int nMaxCols,  \n    SIZE sizeMin,  \n    CCreateContext* pContext,  \n    DWORD dwStyle = WS_CHILD | WS_VISIBLE | WS_HSCROLL | WS_VSCROLL | SPLS_DYNAMIC_SPLIT,  \n    UINT nID = AFX_IDW_PANE_FIRST);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `pParentWnd`  \n The parent frame window of the splitter window.  \n  \n *nMaxRows*  \n The maximum number of rows in the splitter window.

Call the **Create** member function from within the overridden `OnCreateClient`.  \n  \n When you create a splitter window from within a parent frame, pass the parent frame's `pContext` parameter to the splitter window. Otherwise, this parameter can be **NULL**.  \n  \n The initial minimum row height and column width of a dynamic splitter window are set by the `sizeMin` parameter. These minimums, which determine whether a pane is too small to be shown in its entirety, can be changed with the [SetRowInfo](#csplitterwnd__setrowinfo) and [SetColumnInfo](#csplitterwnd__setcolumninfo) member functions.  \n  \n For more on dynamic splitter windows, see \"Splitter Windows\" in the article [Multiple Document Types, Views, and Frame Windows](../../mfc/multiple-document-types-views-and-frame-windows.md), [Technical Note 29](../../mfc/tn029-splitter-windows.md), and the [CSplitterWnd](../../mfc/reference/csplitterwnd-class.md) class overview.  \n  \n### Example  \n [!code-cpp[NVC_MFCWindowing#125](../../mfc/reference/codesnippet/cpp/csplitterwnd-class_1.cpp)]  \n  \n##  <a name=\"csplitterwnd__createscrollbarctrl\"></a>  CSplitterWnd::CreateScrollBarCtrl  \n Called by the framework to create a shared scroll bar control.  \n  \n```  \nvirtual BOOL CreateScrollBarCtrl(\n    DWORD dwStyle,  \n    UINT nID);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `dwStyle`  \n Specifies the window style.  \n  \n `nID`  \n The child window ID of the window.

Embed a `CSplitterWnd` member variable in the parent frame.  \n  \n2.  Override the parent frame's `OnCreateClient` member function.  \n  \n3.  Call the `CreateStatic` member function from within the overridden [CFrameWnd::OnCreateClient](../../mfc/reference/cframewnd-class.md#cframewnd__oncreateclient).  \n  \n A static splitter window contains a fixed number of panes, often from different classes.  \n  \n When you create a static splitter window, you must at the same time create all its panes. The [CreateView](#csplitterwnd__createview) member function is usually used for this purpose, but you can create other nonview classes as well.  \n  \n The initial minimum row height and column width for a static splitter window is 0. These minimums, which determine when a pane is too small to be shown in its entirety, can be changed with the [SetRowInfo](#csplitterwnd__setrowinfo) and [SetColumnInfo](#csplitterwnd__setcolumninfo) member functions.  \n  \n To add scroll bars to a static splitter window, add the **WS_HSCROLL** and **WS_VSCROLL** styles to `dwStyle`.  \n  \n See \"Splitter Windows\" in the article [Multiple Document Types, Views, and Frame Windows](../../mfc/multiple-document-types-views-and-frame-windows.md), [Technical Note 29](../../mfc/tn029-splitter-windows.md), and the [CSplitterWnd](../../mfc/reference/csplitterwnd-class.md) class overview for more on static splitter windows.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"csplitterwnd__createview\"></a>  CSplitterWnd::CreateView  \n Creates the panes for a static splitter window.  \n  \n```  \nvirtual BOOL CreateView(\n    int row,  \n    int col,  \n    CRuntimeClass* pViewClass,  \n    SIZE sizeInit,  \n    CCreateContext* pContext);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `row`  \n Specifies the splitter window row in which to place the new view.  \n  \n `col`  \n Specifies the splitter window column in which to place the new view.  \n  \n `pViewClass`  \n Specifies the [CRuntimeClass](../../mfc/reference/cruntimeclass-structure.md) of the new view.  \n  \n *sizeInit*  \n Specifies the initial size of the new view.  \n  \n `pContext`  \n A pointer to a creation context used to create the view (usually the `pContext` passed into the parent frame's overridden [CFrameWnd::OnCreateClient](../../mfc/reference/cframewnd-class.md#cframewnd__oncreateclient) member function in which the splitter window is being created).  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Nonzero if successful; otherwise 0.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n All panes of a static splitter window must be created before the framework displays the splitter.  \n  \n The framework also calls this member function to create new panes when the user of a dynamic splitter window splits a pane, row, or column.  \n  \n### Example  \n [!code-cpp[NVC_MFCWindowing#4](../../mfc/reference/codesnippet/cpp/csplitterwnd-class_2.cpp)]  \n  \n##  <a name=\"csplitterwnd__csplitterwnd\"></a>  CSplitterWnd::CSplitterWnd  \n Call to construct a `CSplitterWnd` object.  \n  \n```  \nCSplitterWnd();\n```  \n  \n### Remarks  \n Construct a `CSplitterWnd` object in two steps.

The default imagery is similar to the splitter in Microsoft Works for Windows or Microsoft Windows 95/98, in that the intersections of the splitter bars are blended together.  \n  \n For more on dynamic splitter windows, see \"Splitter Windows\" in the article [Multiple Document Types, Views, and Frame Windows](../../mfc/multiple-document-types-views-and-frame-windows.md), [Technical Note 29](../../mfc/tn029-splitter-windows.md), and the [CSplitterWnd](../../mfc/reference/csplitterwnd-class.md) class overview.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"csplitterwnd__oninverttracker\"></a>  CSplitterWnd::OnInvertTracker  \n Renders the image of a split window to be the same size and shape as the frame window.  \n  \n```  \nvirtual void OnInvertTracker(const CRect& rect);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `rect`  \n Reference to a `CRect` object specifying the tracking rectangle.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n This member function is called by the framework during resizing of splitters. Override `OnInvertTracker` for advanced customization of the imagery of the splitter window. The default imagery is similar to the splitter in Microsoft Works for Windows or Microsoft Windows 95/98, in that the intersections of the splitter bars are blended together.  \n  \n For more on dynamic splitter windows, see \"Splitter Windows\" in the article [Multiple Document Types, Views, and Frame Windows](../../mfc/multiple-document-types-views-and-frame-windows.md), [Technical Note 29](../../mfc/tn029-splitter-windows.md), and the [CSplitterWnd](../../mfc/reference/csplitterwnd-class.md) class overview.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"csplitterwnd__recalclayout\"></a>  CSplitterWnd::RecalcLayout  \n Call to redisplay the splitter window after adjusting row or column size.  \n  \n```  \nvirtual void RecalcLayout();\n```  \n  \n### Remarks  \n Call this member function to correctly redisplay the splitter window after you have adjusted row and column sizes with the [SetRowInfo](#csplitterwnd__setrowinfo) and [SetColumnInfo](#csplitterwnd__setcolumninfo) member functions. If you change row and column sizes as part of the creation process before the splitter window is visible, it is not necessary to call this member function.  \n  \n The framework calls this member function whenever the user resizes the splitter window or moves a split.  \n  \n### Example  \n  See the example for [CSplitterWnd::SetColumnInfo](#csplitterwnd__setcolumninfo).  \n  \n##  <a name=\"csplitterwnd__setactivepane\"></a>  CSplitterWnd::SetActivePane  \n Sets a pane to be the active one in the frame.  \n  \n```  \nvirtual void SetActivePane(\n    int row,  \n    int col,  \n    CWnd* pWnd = NULL);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `row`  \n If `pWnd` is **NULL**, specifies the row in the pane that will be active.  \n  \n `col`  \n If `pWnd` is **NULL**, specifies the column in the pane that will be active.  \n  \n `pWnd`  \n A pointer to a `CWnd` object. If **NULL**, the pane specified by `row` and `col` is set active. If not **NULL**, specifies the pane that is set active.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n This member function is called by the framework to set a pane as active when the user changes the focus to a pane within the frame window. You can explicitly call `SetActivePane` to change the focus to the specified view.  \n  \n Specify pane by providing either row and column, **or** by providing `pWnd`.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"csplitterwnd__setcolumninfo\"></a>  CSplitterWnd::SetColumnInfo  \n Call to set the specified column information.  \n  \n```  \nvoid SetColumnInfo(\n    int col,  \n    int cxIdeal,  \n    int cxMin);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `col`  \n Specifies a splitter window column.  \n  \n *cxIdeal*  \n Specifies an ideal width for the splitter window column in pixels.  \n  \n `cxMin`  \n Specifies a minimum width for the splitter window column in pixels.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n Call this member function to set a new minimum width and ideal width for a column. The column minimum value determines when the column will be too small to be fully displayed.  \n  \n When the framework displays the splitter window, it lays out the panes in columns and rows according to their ideal dimensions, working from the upper-left to the lower-right corner of the splitter window's client area.  \n  \n### Example  \n [!code-cpp[NVC_MFCWindowing#6](../../mfc/reference/codesnippet/cpp/csplitterwnd-class_4.cpp)]  \n  \n##  <a name=\"csplitterwnd__setrowinfo\"></a>  CSplitterWnd::SetRowInfo  \n Call to set the specified row information.  \n  \n```  \nvoid SetRowInfo(\n    int row,  \n    int cyIdeal,  \n    int cyMin);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `row`  \n Specifies a splitter window row.  \n  \n *cyIdeal*  \n Specifies an ideal height for the splitter window row in pixels.  \n  \n `cyMin`  \n Specifies a minimum height for the splitter window row in pixels.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n Call this member function to set a new minimum height and ideal height for a row. The row minimum value determines when the row will be too small to be fully displayed.  \n  \n When the framework displays the splitter window, it lays out the panes in columns and rows according to their ideal dimensions, working from the upper-left to the lower-right corner of the splitter window's client area.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"csplitterwnd__setscrollstyle\"></a>  CSplitterWnd::SetScrollStyle  \n Specifies the new scroll style for the splitter window's shared scroll-bar support.  \n  \n```  \nvoid SetScrollStyle(DWORD dwStyle);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `dwStyle`  \n The new scroll style for the splitter window's shared scroll-bar support, which can be one of the following values:  \n  \n- **WS_HSCROLL** Create/show horizontal shared scroll bars.  \n  \n- **WS_VSCROLL** Create/show vertical shared scroll bars.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n Once a scroll bar is created it will not be destroyed even if `SetScrollStyle` is called without that style; instead those scroll bars are hidden. This allows the scroll bars to retain their state even though they are hidden. After calling `SetScrollStyle` it is necessary to call [RecalcLayout](#csplitterwnd__recalclayout) for all the changes to take effect.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"csplitterwnd__splitcolumn\"></a>  CSplitterWnd::SplitColumn  \n Indicates where a frame window splits vertically.  \n  \n```  \nvirtual BOOL SplitColumn(int cxBefore);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n *cxBefore*  \n The position, in pixels, before which the split occurs.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Nonzero if successful; otherwise 0.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n This member function is called when a vertical splitter window is created. `SplitColumn` indicates the default location where the split occurs.  \n  \n `SplitColumn` is called by the framework to implement the logic of the dynamic splitter window (that is, if the splitter window has the **SPLS_DYNAMIC_SPLIT** style). It can be customized, along with the virtual function [CreateView](#csplitterwnd__createview), to implement more advanced dynamic splitters.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"csplitterwnd__splitrow\"></a>  CSplitterWnd::SplitRow  \n Indicates where a frame window splits horizontally.  \n  \n```  \nvirtual BOOL SplitRow(int cyBefore);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n *cyBefore*  \n The position, in pixels, before which the split occurs.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Nonzero if successful; otherwise 0.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n This member function is called when a horizontal splitter window is created. `SplitRow` indicates the default location where the split occurs.  \n  \n `SplitRow` is called by the framework to implement the logic of the dynamic splitter window (that is, if the splitter window has the **SPLS_DYNAMIC_SPLIT** style). It can be customized, along with the virtual function [CreateView](#csplitterwnd__createview), to implement more advanced dynamic splitters.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"csplitterwnd__ondraw\"></a>  CSplitterWnd::OnDraw  \n Called by the framework to draw the splitter window.  \n  \n```  \nvirtual void OnDraw(CDC* pDC);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `pDC`  \n A pointer to a device context.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n  \n## See Also  \n [MFC Sample VIEWEX](../../visual-cpp-samples.md)   \n [CWnd Class](../../mfc/reference/cwnd-class.md)   \n [Hierarchy Chart](../../mfc/hierarchy-chart.md)   \n [CView Class](../../mfc/reference/cview-class.md)   \n [CWnd Class](../../mfc/reference/cwnd-class.md)\n"}
