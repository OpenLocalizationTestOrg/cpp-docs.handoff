classes are used by container applications. Both `COleLinkingDoc` and `COleDocument` manage collections of `COleClientItem` objects. Rather than deriving your document class from **CDocument**, you'll derive it from `COleLinkingDoc` or `COleDocument`, depending on whether you want support for links to objects embedded in your document.  \n  \n Use a `COleClientItem` object to represent each OLE item in your document that is embedded from another document or is a link to another document.  \n  \n [COleDocObjectItem](../mfc/reference/coledocobjectitem-class.md)  \n Supports active document containment.  \n  \n [COleDocument](../mfc/reference/coledocument-class.md)  \n Used for compound document implementation, as well as basic container support. Serves as a container for classes derived from `CDocItem`. This class can be used as the base class for container documents and is the base class for `COleServerDoc`.  \n  \n [COleLinkingDoc](../mfc/reference/colelinkingdoc-class.md)  \n A class derived from `COleDocument` that provides the infrastructure for linking. You should derive the document classes for your container applications from this class instead of from `COleDocument` if you want them to support links to embedded objects.  \n  \n [CRichEditDoc](../mfc/reference/cricheditdoc-class.md)  \n Maintains the list of OLE client items that are in the rich edit control. Used with [CRichEditView](../mfc/reference/cricheditview-class.md) and [CRichEditCntrItem](../mfc/reference/cricheditcntritem-class.md).  \n  \n [CDocItem](../mfc/reference/cdocitem-class.md)  \n Abstract base class of `COleClientItem` and `COleServerItem`. Objects of classes derived from `CDocItem` represent parts of documents.  \n  \n [COleClientItem](../mfc/reference/coleclientitem-class.md)  \n A client item class that represents the client's side of the connection to an embedded or linked OLE item. Derive your client items from this class.  \n  \n [CRichEditCntrItem](../mfc/reference/cricheditcntritem-class.md)  \n Provides client-side access to an OLE item stored in a rich edit control when used with `CRichEditView` and `CRichEditDoc`.  \n  \n [COleException](../mfc/reference/coleexception-class.md)  \n An exception resulting from a failure in OLE processing. This class is used by both containers and servers.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Class Overview](../mfc/class-library-overview.md)\n\n"}
