Because a one-bit, signed bit field can only contain the values -1 or 0, it is dangerous to compare it to `bool`. No warnings are generated about mixing `bool` and one-bit, unsigned bitfields since they are identical to `bool` and can only hold 0 or 1.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following sample generates C4807:  \n  \n```  \n// C4807.cpp  \n// compile with: /W1  \ntypedef struct bitfield {  \n   signed mybit : 1;  \n} mybitfield;  \n  \nint main() {  \n   mybitfield bf;  \n   bool b = true;  \n  \n   // try..  \n   // int b = true;  \n  \n   bf.mybit = -1;  \n   if (b == bf.mybit) {   // C4807  \n      b = false;  \n   }  \n}  \n```"}
