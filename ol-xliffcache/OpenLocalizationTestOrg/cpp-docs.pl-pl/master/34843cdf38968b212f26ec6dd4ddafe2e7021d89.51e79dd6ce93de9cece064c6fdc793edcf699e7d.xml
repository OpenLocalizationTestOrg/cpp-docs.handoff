We suggest two possible solutions to converting from *type1* to *type2*. The first option is to define a direct conversion from *type1* to *type2*, and the second option is to specify a sequence of conversions from *type1* to *type2*.  \n  \n The following sample generates C2594. The suggested resolution to the error is a sequence of conversions:  \n  \n```  \n// C2594.cpp  \n// compile with: /c  \nstruct A{};  \nstruct I1 : A {};  \nstruct I2 : A {};  \nstruct D : I1, I2 {};  \n  \nA *f (D *p) {  \n   return (A*) (p);    // C2594  \n  \n// try the following line instead  \n// return static_cast<A *>(static_cast<I1 *>(p));  \n}  \n```"}
