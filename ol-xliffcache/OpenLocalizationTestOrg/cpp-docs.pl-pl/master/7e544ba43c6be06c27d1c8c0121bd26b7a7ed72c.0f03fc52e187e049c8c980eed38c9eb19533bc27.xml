Open a dialog box in the Dialog editor.  \n  \n2.  Right click anywhere in the body of the dialog box.  \n  \n3.  On the shortcut menu, click **Insert ActiveX Control**.  \n  \n     The [Insert ActiveX Control dialog box](../mfc/insert-activex-control-dialog-box.md) appears, showing all the ActiveX controls on your system. At the bottom of the dialog box, the path to the ActiveX Control file appears.  \n  \n### To add an ActiveX control to a dialog box  \n  \n1.  In the [Insert ActiveX Control dialog box](../mfc/insert-activex-control-dialog-box.md), select the control you want to add to your dialog box and click **OK**.  \n  \n     The control appears in the dialog box, where you can edit it or create handlers for it just as you would any other control.  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  You can add ActiveX controls to the [Toolbox window](/visualstudio/ide/reference/toolbox).
