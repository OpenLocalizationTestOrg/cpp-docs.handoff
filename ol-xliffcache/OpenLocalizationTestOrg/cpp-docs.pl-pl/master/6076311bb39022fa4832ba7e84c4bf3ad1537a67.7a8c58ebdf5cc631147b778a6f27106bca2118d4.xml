With STL/CLR, you can use all the containers, iterators, and algorithms of STL in a managed environment.  \n  \n To use STL/CLR:  \n  \n-   Include headers from the **cliext** include subdirectory instead of the usual Standard C++ Library equivalents.  \n  \n-   Qualify library names with `cliext::` instead of `std::`.  \n  \n STL/CLR exposes the generic types and interfaces that it uses in cross-assembly scenarios in the .NET assembly **Microsoft.VisualC.STLCLR.dll**. This DLL is included in .NET Framework 3.5. If you redistribute an application that uses STL/CLR, you will need to include the .NET Framework 3.5, as well as any other Visual C++ libraries that your project uses, in the dependencies section of your setup project.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [cliext Namespace](../dotnet/cliext-namespace.md)  \n Discusses the namespace that contains all the types of the STL/CLR Library.  \n  \n [STL/CLR Containers](../dotnet/stl-clr-containers.md)  \n Provides an overview of the containers that are found in the Standard C++ Library, including requirements for container elements, types of elements that can be inserted, and ownership issues.  \n  \n [Requirements for STL/CLR Container Elements](../dotnet/requirements-for-stl-clr-container-elements.md)  \n Describes minimum requirements for all reference types that are inserted into STL containers.  \n  \n [How to: Convert from a .NET Collection to a STL/CLR Container](../dotnet/how-to-convert-from-a-dotnet-collection-to-a-stl-clr-container.md)  \n Describes how to convert a .NET collection to an STL/CLR container.  \n  \n [How to: Convert from a STL/CLR Container to a .NET Collection](../dotnet/how-to-convert-from-a-stl-clr-container-to-a-dotnet-collection.md)  \n Describes how to convert an STL/CLR container to a .NET collection.  \n  \n [How to: Expose an STL/CLR Container from an Assembly](../dotnet/how-to-expose-an-stl-clr-container-from-an-assembly.md)  \n Shows how to display the elements of several STL/CLR containers written in a C++ assembly.  \n  \n In addition, this section also describes the following components of STL/CLR:  \n  \n|||  \n|-|-|  \n|[adapter (STL/CLR)](../dotnet/adapter-stl-clr.md)|[algorithm (STL/CLR)](../dotnet/algorithm-stl-clr.md)|  \n|[deque (STL/CLR)](../dotnet/deque-stl-clr.md)|[for each, in](../dotnet/for-each-in.md)|  \n|[functional (STL/CLR)](../dotnet/functional-stl-clr.md)|[hash_map (STL/CLR)](../dotnet/hash-map-stl-clr.md)|  \n|[hash_multimap (STL/CLR)](../dotnet/hash-multimap-stl-clr.md)|[hash_multiset (STL/CLR)](../dotnet/hash-multiset-stl-clr.md)|  \n|[hash_set (STL/CLR)](../dotnet/hash-set-stl-clr.md)|[list (STL/CLR)](../dotnet/list-stl-clr.md)|  \n|[map (STL/CLR)](../dotnet/map-stl-clr.md)|[multimap (STL/CLR)](../dotnet/multimap-stl-clr.md)|  \n|[multiset (STL/CLR)](../dotnet/multiset-stl-clr.md)|[numeric (STL/CLR)](../dotnet/numeric-stl-clr.md)|  \n|[priority_queue (STL/CLR)](../dotnet/priority-queue-stl-clr.md)|[queue (STL/CLR)](../dotnet/queue-stl-clr.md)|  \n|[set (STL/CLR)](../dotnet/set-stl-clr.md)|[stack (STL/CLR)](../dotnet/stack-stl-clr.md)|  \n|[utility (STL/CLR)](../dotnet/utility-stl-clr.md)|[vector (STL/CLR)](../dotnet/vector-stl-clr.md)|  \n  \n## See Also  \n [C++ Standard Library](../standard-library/cpp-standard-library-reference.md)"}
