Few manipulators, however, actually affect input stream objects. Of those that do, the most important are the radix manipulators, `dec`, `oct`, and `hex`, which determine the conversion base used with numbers from the input stream.  \n  \n On extraction, the `hex` manipulator enables processing of various input formats. For example, c, C, 0xc, 0xC, 0Xc, and 0XC are all interpreted as the decimal integer 12. Any character other than 0 through 9, A through F, a through f, x, and X terminates the numeric conversion. Thus the sequence `\"124n5\"` is converted to the number 124 with the [basic_ios::fail](../standard-library/basic-ios-class.md#basic_ios__fail) bit set.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Input Streams](../standard-library/input-streams.md)\n\n"}
