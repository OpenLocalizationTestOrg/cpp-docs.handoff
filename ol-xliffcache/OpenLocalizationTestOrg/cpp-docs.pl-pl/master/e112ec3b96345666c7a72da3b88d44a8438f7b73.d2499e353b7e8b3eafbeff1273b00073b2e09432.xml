You can add other COM objects (including ActiveX controls) to MFC projects, but the objects might not operate as expected.  \n  \n### To add ATL support to your MFC project  \n  \n1.  In Solution Explorer, right-click the project to which you want to add ATL support.  \n  \n2.  On the shortcut menu, click **Add**, and then click **Add Class**.  \n  \n3.  Select the **Add ATL Support to MFC Project** icon.  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  This icon is located in the ATL folder in the **Categories** pane.  \n  \n4.  When prompted, click **Yes** to add ATL support.  \n  \n For more information about how adding ATL support changes your MFC project's code, see [Details of ATL Support Added by the ATL Wizard](../../mfc/reference/details-of-atl-support-added-by-the-atl-wizard.md)  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Adding a Class](../../ide/adding-a-class-visual-cpp.md)   \n [Adding Functionality with Code Wizards](../../ide/adding-functionality-with-code-wizards-cpp.md)   \n [Adding a Member Function](../../ide/adding-a-member-function-visual-cpp.md)   \n [Adding a Member Variable](../../ide/adding-a-member-variable-visual-cpp.md)   \n [Overriding a Virtual Function](../../ide/overriding-a-virtual-function-visual-cpp.md)   \n [MFC Message Handler](../../mfc/reference/adding-an-mfc-message-handler.md)   \n [Navigating the Class Structure](../../ide/navigating-the-class-structure-visual-cpp.md)\n"}
