Use constants to represent floating-point, integer, enumeration, or character values that cannot be modified.  \n  \n## Syntax  \n `constant`:  \n *floating-point-constant*  \n  \n *integer-constant*  \n  \n *enumeration-constant*  \n  \n *character-constant*  \n  \n Constants are characterized by having a value and a type. [Floating-point](../c-language/c-floating-point-constants.md), [integer](../c-language/c-integer-constants.md), and [character constants](../c-language/c-character-constants.md) are discussed in the next three sections. Enumeration constants are described in [Enumeration Declarations](../c-language/c-enumeration-declarations.md).  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Elements of C](../c-language/elements-of-c.md)"}
