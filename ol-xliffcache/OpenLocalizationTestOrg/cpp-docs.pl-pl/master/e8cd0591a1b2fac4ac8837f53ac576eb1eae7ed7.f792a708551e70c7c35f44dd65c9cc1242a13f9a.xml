If the closing set of angle brackets (**<<**) for an inline file are not at the beginning of a line, the following error occurs:  \n  \n    ```  \n    syntax error : 'EOF' unexpected  \n    ```  \n  \n2.  If a macro definition in the makefile contained an equal sign (**=**) without a preceding name or if the name being defined is a macro that expands to nothing, the following error occurs:  \n  \n    ```  \n    syntax error : '=' unexpected  \n    ```  \n  \n3.  If the semicolon (**;**) in a comment line in TOOLS.INI is not at the beginning of the line, the following error occurs:  \n  \n    ```  \n    syntax error : ';' unexpected  \n    ```  \n  \n4.  If the makefile has been formatted by a word processor, the following error can occur:  \n  \n    ```  \n    syntax error : ':' unexpected  \n    ```"}
