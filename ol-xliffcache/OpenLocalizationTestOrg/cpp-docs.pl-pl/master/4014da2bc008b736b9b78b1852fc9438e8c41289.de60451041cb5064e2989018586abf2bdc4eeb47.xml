(C and C++ symbols are variable names, function names, and labels; that is, names that aren't symbolic constants or `enum` members. You cannot call C++ member functions.)  \n  \n A few restrictions apply to the use of C and C++ symbols:  \n  \n-   Each assembly-language statement can contain only one C or C++ symbol. Multiple symbols can appear in the same assembly instruction only with **LENGTH**, **TYPE**, and **SIZE** expressions.  \n  \n-   Functions referenced in an `__asm` block must be declared (prototyped) earlier in the program. Otherwise, the compiler cannot distinguish between function names and labels in the `__asm` block.  \n  \n-   An `__asm` block cannot use any C or C++ symbols with the same spelling as MASM reserved words (regardless of case). MASM reserved words include instruction names such as **PUSH** and register names such as SI.  \n  \n-   Structure and union tags are not recognized in `__asm` blocks.  \n  \n **END Microsoft Specific**  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Using C or C++ in __asm Blocks](../../assembler/inline/using-c-or-cpp-in-asm-blocks.md)"}
