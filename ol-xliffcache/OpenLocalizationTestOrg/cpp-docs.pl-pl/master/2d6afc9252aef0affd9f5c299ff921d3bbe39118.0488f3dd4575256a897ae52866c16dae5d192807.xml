`propagator_block` which can accept messages of one type and is capable of storing an unbounded number of messages of a different type.  \n  \n## Syntax  \n  \n```\ntemplate<class _Input, class _Output>\nclass transformer : public propagator_block<single_link_registry<ITarget<_Output>>,\n    multi_link_registry<ISource<_Input>>>;\n```   \n  \n#### Parameters  \n `_Input`  \n The payload type of the messages accepted by the buffer.  \n  \n `_Output`  \n The payload type of the messages stored and propagated out by the buffer.  \n  \n## Members  \n  \n### Public Constructors  \n

The `Scheduler` object used is implied by the schedule group.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The runtime uses the default scheduler if you do not specify the `_PScheduler` or `_PScheduleGroup` parameters.  \n  \n The type `_Transform_method` is a functor with signature `_Output (_Input const &)` which is invoked by this `transformer` messaging block to process a message.  \n  \n The type `filter_method` is a functor with signature `bool (_Input const &)` which is invoked by this `transformer` messaging block to determine whether or not it should accept an offered message.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"dtor\"></a>  transformer::~transformer Destructor  \n Destroys the `transformer` messaging block.  \n  \n```\n~transformer();\n```  \n  \n## See Also  \n [concurrency Namespace](concurrency-namespace.md)   \n [call Class](call-class.md)\n"}
