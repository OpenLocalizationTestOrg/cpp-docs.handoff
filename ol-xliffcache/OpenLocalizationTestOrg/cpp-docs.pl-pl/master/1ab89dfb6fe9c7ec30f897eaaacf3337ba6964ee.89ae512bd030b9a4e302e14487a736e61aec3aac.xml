Use the **Close** member function. This function closes the file-system file and flushes buffers if necessary.  \n  \n If you allocated the [CFile](../mfc/reference/cfile-class.md) object on the frame (as in the example shown in [Opening Files](../mfc/opening-files.md)), the object will automatically be closed and then destroyed when it goes out of scope. Note that deleting the `CFile` object does not delete the physical file in the file system.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Files](../mfc/files-in-mfc.md)\n\n"}
