__vmx_vmclear\n**Microsoft Specific**  \n  \n Initializes the specified virtual machine control structure (VMCS) and sets its launch state to `Clear`.  \n  \n## Syntax  \n  \n```  \nunsigned char __vmx_vmclear(  \n   unsigned __int64 *VmcsPhysicalAddress  \n);  \n```  \n  \n#### Parameters  \n  \n|Parameter|Description|  \n|---------------|-----------------|  \n|[in] `VmcsPhysicalAddress`|A pointer to a 64-bit memory location that contains the physical address of the VMCS to clear.|  \n  \n## Return Value  \n  \n|Value|Meaning|  \n|-----------|-------------|  \n|0|The operation succeeded.|  \n|1|The operation failed with extended status available in the `VM-instruction error field` of the current VMCS.|  \n|2|The operation failed without status available.|  \n  \n## Remarks  \n An application can perform a VM-enter operation by using either the [__vmx_vmlaunch](../intrinsics/vmx-vmlaunch.md) or [__vmx_vmresume](../intrinsics/vmx-vmresume.md) function. The [__vmx_vmlaunch](../intrinsics/vmx-vmlaunch.md) function can be used only with a VMCS whose launch state is `Clear`, and the [__vmx_vmresume](../intrinsics/vmx-vmresume.md) function can be used only with a VMCS whose launch state is `Launched`. Consequently, use the [__vmx_vmclear](../intrinsics/vmx-vmclear.md) function to set the launch state of a VMCS to `Clear`. Use the [__vmx_vmlaunch](../intrinsics/vmx-vmlaunch.md) function for your first VM-enter operation and the [__vmx_vmresume](../intrinsics/vmx-vmresume.md) function for subsequent VM-enter operations.  \n  \n The `__vmx_vmclear` function is equivalent to the `VMCLEAR` machine instruction. This function supports the interaction of a host's virtual machine monitor with a guest operating system and its applications.
