Calling a stored procedure is similar to invoking a SQL command. Using stored procedures on the data source (instead of executing or preparing a statement in the client application) can provide several advantages, including higher performance, reduced network overhead, and improved consistency and accuracy.  \n  \n A stored procedure can have any number of (including zero) input or output parameters and can pass a return value. You can either hard code parameter values as specific data values or use a parameter marker (a question mark '?').  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  CLR SQL Server stored procedures created using Visual C++ must be compiled with the **/clr:safe** compiler option.  \n  \n The OLE DB provider for SQL Server (SQLOLEDB) supports the following mechanisms that stored procedures use to return data:  \n  \n-   Every SELECT statement in the procedure generates a result set.  \n  \n-   The procedure can return data through output parameters.  \n  \n-   The procedure can have an integer return code.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  You cannot use stored procedures with the OLE DB provider for Jet because that provider does not support stored procedures; only constants are allowed in query strings.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Working with OLE DB Consumer Templates](../../data/oledb/working-with-ole-db-consumer-templates.md)"}
