You can create isolated applications to consume COM components.  \n  \n### To add COM references to manifests of isolated applications  \n  \n1.  Open the project property pages for the isolated application.  \n  \n2.  Expand the **Configuration Properties** node, and then expand the **Manifest Tool** node.  \n  \n3.  Select the **Isolated COM** property page, and then set the **Component File Name** property to the name of the COM component that you want the isolated application to consume.  \n  \n4.  Click **OK**.  \n  \n### To build manifests into isolated applications  \n  \n1.  Open the project property pages for the isolated application.  \n  \n2.  Expand the **Configuration Properties** node, and then expand the **Manifest Tool** node.  \n  \n3.  Select the **Input and Output** property page, and then set the **Embed Manifest** property equal to **Yes**.  \n  \n4.  Click **OK**.  \n  \n5.  Build the solution.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Isolated Applications](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa375190)   \n [About Side-by-Side Assemblies](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ff951640)"}
