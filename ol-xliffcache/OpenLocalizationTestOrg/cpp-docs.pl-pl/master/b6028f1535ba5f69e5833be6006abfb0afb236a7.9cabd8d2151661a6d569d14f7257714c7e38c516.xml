The main interface of the control is similar in functionality to a combo box. However, if the user expands the control, a month calendar control appears (by default), allowing the user to specify a particular date. When a date is chosen, the month calendar control automatically disappears.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  To use both the **CDateTimePicker** and `CMonthCalCtrl` classes in your project, you must include AFXDTCTL.H, usually in your project's STDAFX.H file.  \n  \n## What do you want to know more about  \n  \n-   [Creating the Date and Time Picker Control](../mfc/creating-the-date-and-time-picker-control.md)  \n  \n-   [Date and Time Picker Control Examples](../mfc/date-and-time-picker-control-examples.md)  \n  \n-   [Accessing the Embedded Month Calendar Control](../mfc/accessing-the-embedded-month-calendar-control.md)  \n  \n-   [Using Custom Format Strings in a Date and Time Picker Control](../mfc/using-custom-format-strings-in-a-date-and-time-picker-control.md)  \n  \n-   [Using Callback Fields in a Date and Time Picker Control](../mfc/using-callback-fields-in-a-date-and-time-picker-control.md)  \n  \n-   [Processing Notification Messages in Date and Time Picker Controls](../mfc/processing-notification-messages-in-date-and-time-picker-controls.md)  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Controls](../mfc/controls-mfc.md)\n\n"}
