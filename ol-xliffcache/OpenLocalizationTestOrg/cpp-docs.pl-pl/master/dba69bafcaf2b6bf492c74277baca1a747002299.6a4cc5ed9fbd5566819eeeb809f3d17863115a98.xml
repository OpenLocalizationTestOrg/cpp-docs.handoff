The symbols and fonts are as follows:  \n  \n|Attribute|Description|  \n|---------------|-----------------|  \n|*nonterminal*|Italic type indicates nonterminals.|  \n|#include|Terminals in bold type are literal reserved words and symbols that must be entered as shown. Characters in this context are always case sensitive.|  \n|opt|Nonterminals followed by opt are always optional.|  \n|default typeface|Characters in the set described or listed in this typeface can be used as terminals in statements.|  \n  \n A colon (:) following a nonterminal introduces its definition. Alternative definitions are listed on separate lines.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Grammar Summary (C/C++)](../preprocessor/grammar-summary-c-cpp.md)"}
