Each item consists of a label and an optional bitmapped image, and each item can have a list of subitems associated with it. By clicking an item, the user can expand and collapse the associated list of subitems. The directory tree in the left-hand pane of File Explorer is an example of a tree control.  \n  \n## What do you want to know more about  \n  \n-   [CTreeCtrl vs. CTreeView](../mfc/ctreectrl-vs-ctreeview.md)  \n  \n-   [Using Tree Controls](../mfc/using-tree-controls.md)  \n  \n-   [Communicating with a Tree Control](../mfc/communicating-with-a-tree-control.md)  \n  \n-   [Tree Control Styles](../mfc/tree-control-styles.md)  \n  \n-   [Tree Control Parent and Child Items](../mfc/tree-control-parent-and-child-items.md)  \n  \n-   [Tree Control Item Position](../mfc/tree-control-item-position.md)  \n  \n-   [Tree Control Item Labels](../mfc/tree-control-item-labels.md)  \n  \n-   [Tree Control Label Editing](../mfc/tree-control-label-editing.md)  \n  \n-   [Tree Control Item States Overview](../mfc/tree-control-item-states-overview.md)  \n  \n-   [Tree Control Image Lists](../mfc/tree-control-image-lists.md)  \n  \n-   [Tree Control Item Selection](../mfc/tree-control-item-selection.md)  \n  \n-   [Tree Control Drag-and-Drop Operations](../mfc/tree-control-drag-and-drop-operations.md)  \n  \n-   [Tree Control Item Information](../mfc/tree-control-item-information.md)  \n  \n-   [Tree Control Notification Messages](../mfc/tree-control-notification-messages.md)  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Controls](../mfc/controls-mfc.md)\n\n"}
