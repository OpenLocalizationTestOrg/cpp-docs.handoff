A reference is not an object, but inline assembler code is not able to make the distinction. The compiler generates code as though ***object*** were an instance.  \n  \n The following sample generates C4537:  \n  \n```  \n// C4537.cpp  \n// compile with: /W1 /c  \n// processor: x86  \nstruct S {  \n   int member;  \n};  \n  \nvoid f1(S &s) {  \n   __asm mov eax, s.member;   // C4537  \n   // try the following code instead  \n   // or, make the declaration \"void f1(S s)\"  \n   /*  \n   mov eax, s  \n   mov eax, [eax]s.member  \n   */  \n}  \n```"}
