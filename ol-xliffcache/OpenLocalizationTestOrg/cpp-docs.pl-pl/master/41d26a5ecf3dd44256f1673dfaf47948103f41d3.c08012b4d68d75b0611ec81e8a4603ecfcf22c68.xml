However, the type library contained a reference to another type library that was not referenced with `#import`. This other .tlb file was not found by the compiler.  \n  \n Note that the compiler will not find type libraries in different directories if you use the [/I (Additional Include Directories)](../../build/reference/i-additional-include-directories.md) compiler option to specify those directories. If you want the compiler to find type libraries in different directories, add those directories to the PATH environment variable.  \n  \n This warning is, by default, issued as an error.
