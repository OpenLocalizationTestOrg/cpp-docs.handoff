The value of the key is unique and is used to automatically sort the data.  \n  \n The value of an element in a map can be changed directly. The key value is a constant and cannot be changed. Instead, key values associated with old elements must be deleted, and new key values must be inserted for new elements.  \n  \n## Syntax  \n  \n```  \ntemplate <class Key,   \n    class Type,   \n    class Traits = less<Key>,   \n    class Allocator=allocator<pair <const Key, Type>>>  \nclass map;  \n```  \n  \n#### Parameters  \n `Key`  \n The key data type to be stored in the map.  \n  \n `Type`  \n The element data type to be stored in the map.  \n  \n `Traits`  \n The type that provides a function object that can compare two element values as sort keys to determine their relative order in the map. This argument is optional and the binary predicate `less<``Key``>` is the default value.  \n  \n In C++14 you can enable heterogeneous lookup by specifying the std::less<> predicate that has no type parameters. For more information, see [Heterogeneous Lookup in Associative Containers](../standard-library/stl-containers.md#sequence_containers)  \n  \n `Allocator`  \n The type that represents the stored allocator object that encapsulates details about the map's allocation and deallocation of memory. This argument is optional and the default value is `allocator<pair``<const``Key`*,* `Type``> >`.  \n  \n## Remarks  \n The Standard Template Library (STL) map class is:  \n  \n-   A container of variable size that efficiently retrieves element values based on associated key values.  \n  \n-   Reversible, because it provides bidirectional iterators to access its elements.  \n  \n-   Sorted, because its elements are ordered by key values according to a specified comparison function.  \n  \n-   Unique. because each of its elements must have a unique key.  \n  \n-   A pair-associative container, because its element data values are distinct from its key values.  \n  \n-   A template class, because the functionality it provides is generic and independent of element or key type. The data types used for elements and keys are specified as parameters in the class template together with the comparison function and allocator.  \n  \n The iterator provided by the map class is a bidirectional iterator, but the [insert](#map__insert) and [map](#map__map) class member functions have versions that take as template parameters a weaker input iterator, whose functionality requirements are fewer than those guaranteed by the class of bidirectional iterators. The different iterator concepts are related by refinements in their functionality. Each iterator concept has its own set of requirements, and the algorithms that work with it must be limited by those requirements. An input iterator may be dereferenced to refer to some object and may be incremented to the next iterator in the sequence.  \n  \n We recommend that you base the choice of container type on the kind of searching and inserting that is required by the application. Associative containers are optimized for the operations of lookup, insertion, and removal. The member functions that explicitly support these operations perform them in a worst-case time that is proportional to the logarithm of the number of elements in the container. Inserting elements invalidates no iterators, and removing elements invalidates only those iterators that specifically pointed to the removed elements.  \n  \n We recommend that you make the map the associative container of choice when conditions that associate values with keys are satisfied by the application. A model for this kind of structure is an ordered list of uniquely occurring key words that have associated string values that provide definitions. If a word has more than one correct definition, so that key is not unique, then a multimap would be the container of choice. If just the list of words is being stored, then a set would be the appropriate container. If multiple occurrences of the words are allowed, then a multiset would be appropriate.  \n  \n The map orders the elements it controls by calling a stored function object of type [key_compare](#map__key_compare). This stored object is a comparison function that is accessed by calling the [key_comp](#map__key_comp) method. In general, any two given elements are compared to determine whether one is less than the other or whether they are equivalent. As all elements are compared, an ordered sequence of non-equivalent elements is created.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The comparison function is a binary predicate that induces a strict weak ordering in the standard mathematical sense. A binary predicate                     f(x,y) is a function object that has two argument objects                     x and                     y, and a return value of `true` or `false`. An ordering imposed on a set is a strict weak ordering if the binary predicate is irreflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive, and if equivalence is transitive, where two objects                     x and                     y are defined to be equivalent when both                     f(x,y)and                     f(y,x) are `false`. If the stronger condition of equality between keys replaces that of equivalence, the ordering becomes total (in the sense that all the elements are ordered with regard to one other), and the keys matched will be indiscernible from one other.  \n>   \n>  In C++14 you can enable heterogeneous lookup by specifying the `std::less<>` or `std::greater<>` predicate that has no type parameters.

The `difference_type` is typically used to represent the number of elements in the range *[ first,  last)* between the iterators ` first` and ` last`, includes the element pointed to by ` first` and the range of elements up to, but not including, the element pointed to by ` last`.  \n  \n Note that although `difference_type` is available for all iterators that satisfy the requirements of an input iterator, which includes the class of bidirectional iterators supported by reversible containers such as set, subtraction between iterators is only supported by random access iterators provided by a random access container such as vector.  \n  \n### Example  \n  \n```cpp  \n// map_diff_type.cpp  \n// compile with: /EHsc  \n#include <iostream>  \n#include <map>  \n#include <algorithm>  \n  \nint main( )  \n{  \n   using namespace std;  \n   map <int, int> m1;  \n   typedef pair <int, int> Int_Pair;  \n  \n   m1.insert ( Int_Pair ( 2, 20 ) );  \n   m1.insert ( Int_Pair ( 1, 10 ) );  \n   m1.insert ( Int_Pair ( 3, 20 ) );  \n   m1.insert ( Int_Pair ( 2, 30 ) );  \n  \n   map <int, int>::iterator m1_Iter, m1_bIter, m1_eIter;  \n   m1_bIter = m1.begin( );  \n   m1_eIter = m1.end( );  \n  \n   // Count the number of elements in a map  \n   map <int, int>::difference_type  df_count = 1;  \n   m1_Iter = m1.begin( );  \n   while ( m1_Iter != m1_eIter)  \n   {  \n      df_count++;  \n      m1_Iter++;  \n   }  \n  \n   cout << \"The number of elements in the map m1 is: \"   \n        << df_count << \".\" << endl;  \n}  \n```  \n  \n```Output  \nThe number of elements in the map m1 is: 4.  \n```  \n  \n##  <a name=\"map__emplace\"></a>  map::emplace  \n Inserts an element constructed in place (no copy or move operations are performed) into a map.  \n  \n```  \ntemplate <class...

The iterator component of the return-value pair points to the newly inserted element if the `bool` component is true, or to the existing element if the `bool` component is false.  \n  \n To access the iterator component of a `pair``pr`, use `pr.first`; to dereference it, use `*pr.first`. To access the `bool` component, use `pr.second`. For an example, see the sample code later in this article.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n No iterators or references are invalidated by this function.  \n  \n During emplacement, if an exception is thrown, the container's state is not modified.  \n  \n The [value_type](#map__value_type) of an element is a pair, so that the value of an element will be an ordered pair with the first component equal to the key value and the second component equal to the data value of the element.  \n  \n### Example  \n  \n```cpp  \n  \n// map_emplace.cpp  \n// compile with: /EHsc  \n#include <map>  \n#include <string>  \n#include <iostream>  \n  \nusing namespace std;  \n  \ntemplate <typename M> void print(const M& m) {  \n    cout << m.size() << \" elements: \";  \n  \n    for (const auto& p : m) {  \n        cout << \"(\" << p.first << \", \" << p.second << \") \";  \n    }  \n  \n    cout << endl;  \n}  \n  \nint main()  \n{  \n    map<int, string> m1;  \n  \n    auto ret = m1.emplace(10, \"ten\");  \n  \n    if (!ret.second){  \n        auto pr = *ret.first;  \n        cout << \"Emplace failed, element with key 10 already exists.\"  \n            << endl << \"  The existing element is (\" << pr.first << \", \" << pr.second << \")\"  \n            << endl;  \n        cout << \"map not modified\" << endl;  \n    }  \n    else{  \n        cout << \"map modified, now contains \";  \n        print(m1);  \n    }  \n    cout << endl;  \n  \n    ret = m1.emplace(10, \"one zero\");  \n  \n    if (!ret.second){  \n        auto pr = *ret.first;  \n        cout << \"Emplace failed, element with key 10 already exists.\"  \n            << endl << \"  The existing element is (\" << pr.first << \", \" << pr.second << \")\"  \n            << endl;  \n    }  \n    else{  \n        cout << \"map modified, now contains \";  \n        print(m1);  \n    }  \n    cout << endl;  \n}  \n  \n```  \n  \n##  <a name=\"map__emplace_hint\"></a>  map::emplace_hint  \n Inserts an element constructed in place (no copy or move operations are performed), with a placement hint.  \n  \n```  \ntemplate <class...

(If that point immediately precedes `Where`, insertion can occur in amortized constant time instead of logarithmic time.)|  \n|`ValTy`|Template parameter that specifies the argument type that the map can use to construct an element of [value_type](#map__value_type), and perfect-forwards `Val` as an argument.|  \n|`First`|The position of the first element to be copied.|  \n|`Last`|The position just beyond the last element to be copied.|  \n|`InputIterator`|Template function argument that meets the requirements of an [input iterator](../standard-library/input-iterator-tag-struct.md) that points to elements of a type that can be used to construct [value_type](#map__value_type) objects.|  \n|`IList`|The [initializer_list](../standard-library/initializer-list.md) from which to copy the elements.|  \n  \n### Return Value  \n The single-element member functions, (1) and (2), return a [pair](../standard-library/pair-structure.md) whose `bool` component is true if an insertion was made, and false if the map already contained an element whose key had an equivalent value in the ordering. The iterator component of the return-value pair points to the newly inserted element if the `bool` component is true, or to the existing element if the `bool` component is false.  \n  \n The single-element-with-hint member functions, (3) and (4), return an iterator that points to the position where the new element was inserted into the map or, if an element with an equivalent key already exists, to the existing element.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n No iterators, pointers, or references are invalidated by this function.  \n  \n During the insertion of just one element, if an exception is thrown, the container's state is not modified. During the insertion of multiple elements, if an exception is thrown, the container is left in an unspecified but valid state.  \n  \n To access the iterator component of a `pair``pr` that's returned by the single-element member functions, use `pr.first`; to dereference the iterator within the returned pair, use `*pr.first`, giving you an element. To access the `bool` component, use `pr.second`. For an example, see the sample code later in this article.  \n  \n The [value_type](#map__value_type) of a container is a typedef that belongs to the container, and for map, `map<K, V>::value_type` is `pair<const K, V>`. The value of an element is an ordered pair in which the first component is equal to the key value and the second component is equal to the data value of the element.  \n  \n The range member function (5) inserts the sequence of element values into a map that corresponds to each element addressed by an iterator in the range `[First, Last)`; therefore, `Last` does not get inserted. The container member function `end()` refers to the position just after the last element in the container—for example, the statement `m.insert(v.begin(), v.end());` attempts to insert all elements of `v` into `m`. Only elements that have unique values in the range are inserted; duplicates are ignored. To observe which elements are rejected, use the single-element versions of `insert`.  \n  \n The initializer list member function (6) uses an [initializer_list](../standard-library/initializer-list.md) to copy elements into the map.  \n  \n For insertion of an element constructed in place—that is, no copy or move operations are performed—see [map::emplace](#map__emplace) and [map::emplace_hint](#map__emplace_hint).  \n  \n### Example  \n  \n```cpp  \n  \n// map_insert.cpp  \n// compile with: /EHsc  \n#include <map>  \n#include <iostream>  \n#include <string>  \n#include <vector>  \n#include <utility>  // make_pair()  \n  \nusing namespace std;  \n  \ntemplate <typename M> void print(const M& m) {  \n    cout << m.size() << \" elements: \";  \n  \n    for (const auto& p : m) {  \n        cout << \"(\" << p.first << \", \" << p.second << \") \";  \n    }  \n  \n    cout << endl;  \n}  \n  \nint main()  \n{  \n  \n    // insert single values   \n    map<int, int> m1;  \n    // call insert(const value_type&) version  \n    m1.insert({ 1, 10 });  \n    // call insert(ValTy&&) version   \n    m1.insert(make_pair(2, 20));  \n  \n    cout << \"The original key and mapped values of m1 are:\" << endl;  \n    print(m1);  \n  \n    // intentionally attempt a duplicate, single element  \n    auto ret = m1.insert(make_pair(1, 111));  \n    if (!ret.second){  \n        auto pr = *ret.first;  \n        cout << \"Insert failed, element with key value 1 already exists.\"  \n            << endl << \"  The existing element is (\" << pr.first << \", \" << pr.second << \")\"  \n            << endl;  \n    }  \n    else{  \n        cout << \"The modified key and mapped values of m1 are:\" << endl;  \n        print(m1);  \n    }  \n    cout << endl;  \n  \n    // single element, with hint  \n    m1.insert(m1.end(), make_pair(3, 30));  \n    cout << \"The modified key and mapped values of m1 are:\" << endl;  \n    print(m1);  \n    cout << endl;  \n  \n    // The templatized version inserting a jumbled range  \n    map<int, int> m2;  \n    vector<pair<int, int>> v;  \n    v.push_back(make_pair(43, 294));  \n    v.push_back(make_pair(41, 262));  \n    v.push_back(make_pair(45, 330));  \n    v.push_back(make_pair(42, 277));  \n    v.push_back(make_pair(44, 311));  \n  \n    cout << \"Inserting the following vector data into m2:\" << endl;  \n    print(v);  \n  \n    m2.insert(v.begin(), v.end());  \n  \n    cout << \"The modified key and mapped values of m2 are:\" << endl;  \n    print(m2);  \n    cout << endl;  \n  \n    // The templatized versions move-constructing elements  \n    map<int, string>  m3;  \n    pair<int, string> ip1(475, \"blue\"), ip2(510, \"green\");  \n  \n    // single element  \n    m3.insert(move(ip1));  \n    cout << \"After the first move insertion, m3 contains:\" << endl;  \n    print(m3);  \n  \n    // single element with hint  \n    m3.insert(m3.end(), move(ip2));  \n    cout << \"After the second move insertion, m3 contains:\" << endl;  \n    print(m3);  \n    cout << endl;  \n  \n    map<int, int> m4;  \n    // Insert the elements from an initializer_list  \n    m4.insert({ { 4, 44 }, { 2, 22 }, { 3, 33 }, { 1, 11 }, { 5, 55 } });  \n    cout << \"After initializer_list insertion, m4 contains:\" << endl;  \n    print(m4);  \n    cout << endl;  \n}  \n  \n```  \n  \n##  <a name=\"map__iterator\"></a>  map::iterator  \n A type that provides a bidirectional iterator that can read or modify any element in a map.  \n  \n```  \ntypedef implementation-defined iterator;  \n```  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The **iterator** defined by map points to elements that are objects of [value_type](#map__value_type), that is of type `pair`*\\<***constKey**, **Type***>*, whose first member is the key to the element and whose second member is the mapped datum held by the element.  \n  \n To dereference an **iterator**`Iter` pointing to an element in a map, use the **->** operator.  \n  \n To access the value of the key for the element, use `Iter` -> **first**, which is equivalent to (\\* `Iter`). **first**. To access the value of the mapped datum for the element, use `Iter` -> **second**, which is equivalent to (\\* `Iter`). **second**.  \n  \n### Example  \n  See example for [begin](#map__begin) for an example of how to declare and use **iterator**.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"map__key_comp\"></a>  map::key_comp  \n Retrieves a copy of the comparison object used to order keys in a map.  \n  \n```  \nkey_compare key_comp() const;\n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Returns the function object that a map uses to order its elements.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The stored object defines the member function  \n  \n **bool operator**( **constKey&**` left`, **const Key&**` right`);  \n  \n which returns **true** if ` left` precedes and is not equal to ` right` in the sort order.  \n  \n### Example  \n  \n```cpp  \n// map_key_comp.cpp  \n// compile with: /EHsc  \n#include <map>  \n#include <iostream>  \n  \nint main( )  \n{  \n   using namespace std;  \n  \n   map <int, int, less<int> > m1;  \n   map <int, int, less<int> >::key_compare kc1 = m1.key_comp( ) ;  \n   bool result1 = kc1( 2, 3 ) ;  \n   if( result1 == true )  \n   {  \n      cout << \"kc1( 2,3 ) returns value of true, \"  \n           << \"where kc1 is the function object of m1.\"  \n           << endl;  \n   }  \n   else     \n   {  \n      cout << \"kc1( 2,3 ) returns value of false \"  \n           << \"where kc1 is the function object of m1.\"  \n           << endl;  \n   }  \n  \n   map <int, int, greater<int> > m2;  \n   map <int, int, greater<int> >::key_compare kc2 = m2.key_comp( );  \n   bool result2 = kc2( 2, 3 ) ;  \n   if( result2 == true )  \n   {  \n      cout << \"kc2( 2,3 ) returns value of true, \"  \n           << \"where kc2 is the function object of m2.\"  \n           << endl;  \n   }  \n   else     \n   {  \n      cout << \"kc2( 2,3 ) returns value of false, \"  \n           << \"where kc2 is the function object of m2.\"  \n           << endl;  \n   }  \n}  \n```  \n  \n```Output  \nkc1( 2,3 ) returns value of true, where kc1 is the function object of m1.  \nkc2( 2,3 ) returns value of false, where kc2 is the function object of m2.  \n```  \n  \n##  <a name=\"map__key_compare\"></a>  map::key_compare  \n A type that provides a function object that can compare two sort keys to determine the relative order of two elements in the map.  \n  \n```  \ntypedef Traits key_compare;  \n```  \n  \n### Remarks  \n `key_compare` is a synonym for the template parameter `Traits`.  \n  \n For more information on `Traits` see the [map Class](../standard-library/map-class.md) topic.  \n  \n### Example  \n  See example for [key_comp](#map__key_comp) for an example of how to declare and use `key_compare`.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"map__key_type\"></a>  map::key_type  \n A type that describes the sort key stored in each element of the map.  \n  \n```  \ntypedef Key key_type;  \n```  \n  \n### Remarks  \n `key_type` is a synonym for the template parameter `Key`.  \n  \n For more information on `Key`, see the Remarks section of the [map Class](../standard-library/map-class.md) topic.  \n  \n### Example  \n  See example for [value_type](#map__value_type) for an example of how to declare and use `key_type`.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"map__lower_bound\"></a>  map::lower_bound  \n Returns an iterator to the first element in a map with a key value that is equal to or greater than that of a specified key.  \n  \n```  \niterator lower_bound(const Key& key);\n\nconst_iterator lower_bound(const Key& key) const;\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n ` key`  \n The argument key value to be compared with the sort key of an element from the map being searched.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n An **iterator** or `const_iterator` that addresses the location of an element in a map that with a key that is equal to or greater than the argument key, or that addresses the location succeeding the last element in the map if no match is found for the key.  \n  \n If the return value of `lower_bound` is assigned to a `const_iterator`, the map object cannot be modified.

The allocator parameter is often omitted in the class declarations and preprocessing macros used to substitute alternative allocators.  \n  \n All constructors initialize their map.  \n  \n All constructors store a function object of type Traits that is used to establish an order among the keys of the map and that can later be returned by calling [key_comp](#map__key_comp).  \n  \n The first three constructors specify an empty initial map, the second specifying the type of comparison function ( `Comp`) to be used in establishing the order of the elements and the third explicitly specifying the allocator type ( `Al`) to be used.
