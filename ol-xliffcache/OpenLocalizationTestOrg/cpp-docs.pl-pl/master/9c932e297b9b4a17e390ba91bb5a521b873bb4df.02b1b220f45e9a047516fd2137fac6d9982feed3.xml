The sign of the quotient is the same as that of the mathematical quotient. The absolute value of the quotient is the largest integer that is less than the absolute value of the mathematical quotient. If the denominator is 0, the program terminates with an error message. `ldiv` and `lldiv` are the same as `div`, except that the arguments of `ldiv` and the members of the returned structure are all of type `long`, and the arguments of `lldiv` and the members of the returned structure are of type `long long`.  \n  \n The `ldiv_t` and `lldiv_t` structures are defined in \\<stdlib.h>.  \n  \n## Requirements  \n  \n|Routine|Required header|  \n|-------------|---------------------|  \n|`ldiv`, `lldiv`|\\<stdlib.h>|  \n  \n For additional compatibility information, see [Compatibility](../../c-runtime-library/compatibility.md).  \n  \n## Libraries  \n All versions of the [C run-time libraries](../../c-runtime-library/crt-library-features.md).  \n  \n## Example  \n  \n```  \n// crt_ldiv.c  \n  \n#include <stdlib.h>  \n#include <math.h>  \n#include <stdio.h>  \n  \nint main( void )  \n{  \n   long x = 5149627, y = 234879;  \n   ldiv_t div_result;  \n  \n   div_result = ldiv( x, y );  \n   printf( \"For %ld / %ld, the quotient is \", x, y );  \n   printf( \"%ld, and the remainder is %ld\\n\",   \n            div_result.quot, div_result.rem );  \n}  \n```  \n  \n## Output  \n  \n```  \nFor 5149627 / 234879, the quotient is 21, and the remainder is 217168  \n```  \n  \n## .NET Framework Equivalent  \n Not applicable.
