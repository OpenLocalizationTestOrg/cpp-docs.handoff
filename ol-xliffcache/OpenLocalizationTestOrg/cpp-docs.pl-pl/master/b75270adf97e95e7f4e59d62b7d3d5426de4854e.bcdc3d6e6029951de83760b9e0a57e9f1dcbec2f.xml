New &#124; Project**, ensuring that Visual C++ is selected in the left pane, and then choosing from the list of project templates in the middle pane. When you click on a template, in many cases a wizard will appear that enables you to set various project properties before the project is created. You can view and modify those properties later by using the project's property pages (**Project &#124; Properties**).  \n  \n You can also create new projects by:  \n  \n-   choosing **File &#124; New &#124; Project from Existing Code** and following the prompts to add existing source code files. This option works best for relatively small and simple projects, perhaps 25 source codes files or less with few or no complex dependencies.  \n  \n-   starting with a makefile and choose the Makefile Project template under the General tab.  \n  \n-   creating an empty project (under the **General** tab) and manually adding source code files by right-clicking on the project node in solution explorer and choosing **Add &#124; Existing Item**.  \n  \n-   using the [Win32 Application Wizard](../windows/win32-application-wizard.md).  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Visual C++ Project Types](../ide/visual-cpp-project-types.md)  \n Describes the project types that are available in [!INCLUDE[vcprvc](../build/includes/vcprvc_md.md)] and how to create a C-language project.  \n  \n [File Types Created for Visual C++ Projects](../ide/file-types-created-for-visual-cpp-projects.md)  \n Describes the kinds of files that are used with various project types.  \n  \n [Creating Desktop Projects By Using Application Wizards](../ide/creating-desktop-projects-by-using-application-wizards.md)  \n How to use the wizards to create projects with Visual C++.  \n  \n [Working with Project Properties](../ide/working-with-project-properties.md)  \n Describes how to use Property Pages and Property Sheets to specify your project settings.  \n  \n [Adding Functionality with Code Wizards](../ide/adding-functionality-with-code-wizards-cpp.md)  \n Describes how to add classes, methods, variables, and other elements to your project to add functionality.  \n  \n [Designing a Wizard](../ide/designing-a-wizard.md)  \n Describes concepts on how to create your own wizard that generates code and a user interface for other users.  \n  \n [How to: Organize Project Output Files for Builds](../ide/how-to-organize-project-output-files-for-builds.md)  \n Describes how to organize project output files.  \n  \n## Related Sections  \n [Building C/C++ Programs](../build/building-c-cpp-programs.md)  \n Provides links to topics describing building your program from the command line or from the integrated development environment of Visual Studio.  \n  \n [Visual C++ Reference](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/1ba03b5c-8229-4f63-b08c-6c12141d6ab1)  \n Provides links to topics describing the C and C++ language references, the libraries provided with Visual C++, the Visual C++ Extensibility Object Model, and the Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM).  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Visual Studio SDK](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/extend)"}
