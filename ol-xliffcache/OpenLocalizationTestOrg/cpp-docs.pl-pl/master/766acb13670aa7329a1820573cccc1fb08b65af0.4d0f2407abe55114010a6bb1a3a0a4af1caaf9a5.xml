This address may not be used to access other memory locations (for example, the function's arguments).  \n  \n## Syntax  \n  \n```  \nvoid * _AddressOfReturnAddress();  \n```  \n  \n## Requirements  \n  \n|Intrinsic|Architecture|  \n|---------------|------------------|  \n|`_AddressOfReturnAddress`|x86, [!INCLUDE[vcprx64](../assembler/inline/includes/vcprx64_md.md)]|  \n  \n **Header file** \\<intrin.h>  \n  \n## Remarks  \n When `_AddressOfReturnAddress` is used in a program compiled with [/clr](../build/reference/clr-common-language-runtime-compilation.md), the function containing the `_AddressOfReturnAddress` call is compiled as a native function. When a function compiled as managed calls into the function containing `_AddressOfReturnAddress`, `_AddressOfReturnAddress` might not behave as expected.  \n  \n This routine is only available as an intrinsic.  \n  \n## Example  \n  \n```  \n// compiler_intrinsics_AddressOfReturnAddress.cpp  \n// processor: x86, x64  \n#include <stdio.h>  \n#include <intrin.h>  \n  \n// This function will print three values:  \n//   (1) The address retrieved from _AddressOfReturnAdress  \n//   (2) The return address stored at the location returned in (1)  \n//   (3) The return address retrieved the _ReturnAddress* intrinsic  \n// Note that (2) and (3) should be the same address.  \n__declspec(noinline)  \nvoid func() {  \n   void* pvAddressOfReturnAddress = _AddressOfReturnAddress();  \n   printf_s(\"%p\\n\", pvAddressOfReturnAddress);  \n   printf_s(\"%p\\n\", *((void**) pvAddressOfReturnAddress));  \n   printf_s(\"%p\\n\", _ReturnAddress());  \n}  \n  \nint main() {  \n   func();  \n}  \n```  \n  \n```Output  \n0012FF78  \n00401058  \n00401058  \n```  \n  \n## END Microsoft Specific  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Compiler Intrinsics](../intrinsics/compiler-intrinsics.md)   \n [Keywords](../cpp/keywords-cpp.md)"}
