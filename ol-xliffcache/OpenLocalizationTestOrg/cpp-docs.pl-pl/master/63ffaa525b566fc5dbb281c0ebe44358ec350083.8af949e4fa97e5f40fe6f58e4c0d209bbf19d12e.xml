Same as **/Zp**.  \n  \n 2  \n Packs structures on 2-byte boundaries.  \n  \n 4  \n Packs structures on 4-byte boundaries.  \n  \n 8  \n Packs structures on 8-byte boundaries (default).  \n  \n 16  \n Packs structures on 16-byte boundaries.  \n  \n You should not use this option unless you have specific alignment requirements.  \n  \n You can also use [pack](../../preprocessor/pack.md) to control structure packing. For more information about alignment, see:  \n  \n-   [align](../../cpp/align-cpp.md)  \n  \n-   [__alignof Operator](../../cpp/alignof-operator.md)  \n  \n-   [__unaligned](../../cpp/unaligned.md)  \n  \n-   [Examples of Structure Alignment](../../build/examples-of-structure-alignment.md) (x64 specific)  \n  \n### To set this compiler option in the Visual Studio development environment  \n  \n1.  Open the project's **Property Pages** dialog box. For details, see [Working with Project Properties](../../ide/working-with-project-properties.md).  \n  \n2.  Click the **C/C++** folder.  \n  \n3.  Click the **Code Generation** property page.  \n  \n4.  Modify the **Struct Member Alignment** property.  \n  \n### To set this compiler option programmatically  \n  \n-   See <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.VCProjectEngine.VCCLCompilerTool.StructMemberAlignment%2A>.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Compiler Options](../../build/reference/compiler-options.md)   \n [Setting Compiler Options](../../build/reference/setting-compiler-options.md)"}
