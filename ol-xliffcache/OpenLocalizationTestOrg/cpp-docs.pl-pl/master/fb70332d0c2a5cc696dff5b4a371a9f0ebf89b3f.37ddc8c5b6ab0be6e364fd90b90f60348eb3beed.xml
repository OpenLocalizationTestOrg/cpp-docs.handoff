This is because the `HWND` for the `CWnd` object has not been created yet. Most Windows-specific initialization, such as adding child windows, must be done in an [OnCreate](../mfc/reference/cwnd-class.md#cwnd__oncreate) message handler.  \n  \n## What do you want to know more about  \n  \n-   [Creating document frame windows](../mfc/creating-document-frame-windows.md)  \n  \n-   [Document/view creation](../mfc/document-view-creation.md)  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Using Frame Windows](../mfc/using-frame-windows.md)\n\n"}
