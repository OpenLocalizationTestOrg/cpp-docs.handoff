The exports table contains the name of every function that the DLL exports to other executables. These functions are the entry points into the DLL; only the functions in the exports table can be accessed by other executables. Any other functions in the DLL are private to the DLL. The exports table of a DLL can be viewed by using the [DUMPBIN](../build/reference/dumpbin-reference.md) tool with the /EXPORTS option.  \n  \n You can export functions from a DLL using two methods:  \n  \n-   Create a module definition (.def) file and use the .def file when building the DLL. Use this approach if you want to [export functions from your DLL by ordinal rather than by name](../build/exporting-functions-from-a-dll-by-ordinal-rather-than-by-name.md).  \n  \n-   Use the keyword **__declspec(dllexport)** in the function's definition.  \n  \n When exporting functions with either method, make sure to use the [__stdcall](../cpp/stdcall.md) calling convention.  \n  \n## What do you want to do?  \n  \n-   [Export from a DLL using .def files](../build/exporting-from-a-dll-using-def-files.md)  \n  \n-   [Export from a DLL using __declspec(dllexport)](../build/exporting-from-a-dll-using-declspec-dllexport.md)  \n  \n-   [Export and import using AFX_EXT_CLASS](../build/exporting-and-importing-using-afx-ext-class.md)  \n  \n-   [Export C++ functions for use in C-language executables](../build/exporting-cpp-functions-for-use-in-c-language-executables.md)  \n  \n-   [Export C functions for use in C or C++-language executables](../build/exporting-c-functions-for-use-in-c-or-cpp-language-executables.md)  \n  \n-   [Export functions from a DLL by ordinal rather than by name](../build/exporting-functions-from-a-dll-by-ordinal-rather-than-by-name.md)  \n  \n-   [Determine which exporting method to use](../build/determining-which-exporting-method-to-use.md)  \n  \n-   [Determine which linking method to use](../build/determining-which-linking-method-to-use.md)  \n  \n-   [Initialize a DLL](../build/initializing-a-dll.md)  \n  \n## What do you want to know more about?  \n  \n-   [Importing into an application](../build/importing-into-an-application.md)  \n  \n-   [Importing and exporting inline functions](../build/importing-and-exporting-inline-functions.md)  \n  \n-   [Mutual imports](../build/mutual-imports.md)  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Importing and Exporting](../build/importing-and-exporting.md)"}
