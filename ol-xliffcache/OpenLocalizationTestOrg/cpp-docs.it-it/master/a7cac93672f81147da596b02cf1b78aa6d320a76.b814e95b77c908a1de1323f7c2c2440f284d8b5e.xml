Each class is based on a standard OLE DB component implementation.  \n  \n ![Data source and session classes](../../data/oledb/media/vcdatasourcesessionclasses.gif \"vcdatasourcesessionclasses\")  \nData Source and Session Classes  \n  \n The classes are:  \n  \n-   [CDataSource](../../data/oledb/cdatasource-class.md) This class instantiates the data source object, which creates and manages a connection to a data source through an OLE DB provider. The data source takes information such as the data source address and authentication information in the form of a connection string.  \n  \n     It is also worth noting that the helper class [CEnumerator](../../data/oledb/cenumerator-class.md) is often used before any connection is established to obtain a list of available providers registered on a system. This allows you to select a provider as a data source. For example, the **Data Link Properties** dialog box uses this class to populate the list of providers on the **Providers** tab. It is equivalent to the **SQLBrowseConnect** or **SQLDriverConnect** function.  \n  \n-   [CSession](../../data/oledb/csession-class.md) This class instantiates the session object, which represents a single access session to the data source. However, you can create multiple sessions on a data source. For each session, you can create rowsets, commands, and other objects to access data from the data source. The session handles transactions.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [OLE DB Consumer Templates](../../data/oledb/ole-db-consumer-templates-cpp.md)"}
