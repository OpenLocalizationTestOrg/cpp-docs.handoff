It defines its member function `operator()` as returning ( `left`.\\* *Pm*)( `right`) **const**.  \n  \n## Example  \n The constructor of `const_mem_fun1_ref_t` is not usually used directly; the helper function `mem_fun_ref` is used to adapt member functions. See [mem_fun_ref](../standard-library/functional-functions.md#mem_fun_ref_function) for examples of how to use member function adaptors.  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Header:** \\<functional>  \n  \n **Namespace:** std  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Thread Safety in the C++ Standard Library](../standard-library/thread-safety-in-the-cpp-standard-library.md)   \n [C++ Standard Library Reference](../standard-library/cpp-standard-library-reference.md)\n\n\n\n"}
