From Class View, right-click the main dialog class to open the shortcut menu. For example, `CContainerDlg`.  \n  \n2.  From the shortcut menu, click **Add** and then **Add Variable**.  \n  \n3.  In the Add Member Variable Wizard, click **Control variable**.  \n  \n4.  In the **Control ID** list box, select the control ID of the embedded ActiveX control. For example, `IDC_CIRCCTRL1`.  \n  \n5.  In the **Variable Name** box, enter a name.  \n  \n     For example, `m_circctl`.  \n  \n6.  Click **Finish** to accept your choices and exit the Add Member Variable Wizard.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [ActiveX Control Containers](../mfc/activex-control-containers.md)\n\n"}
