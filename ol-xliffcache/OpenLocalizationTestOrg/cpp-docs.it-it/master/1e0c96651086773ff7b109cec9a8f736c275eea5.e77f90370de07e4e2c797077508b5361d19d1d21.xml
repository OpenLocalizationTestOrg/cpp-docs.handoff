&lt;future&gt;\nInclude the standard header \\<future> to define template classes and supporting templates that simplify running a function—possibly in a separate thread—and retrieving its result. The result is either the value that is returned by the function or an exception that is emitted by the function but is not caught in the function.  \n  \n This header uses Concurrency Runtime (ConcRT) so that you can use it together with other ConcRT mechanisms. For more information about ConcRT, see [Concurrency Runtime](../parallel/concrt/concurrency-runtime.md).  \n  \n## Syntax  \n  \n```cpp  \n#include <future>  \n```  \n  \n## Remarks  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  In code that is compiled by using **/clr** or **/clr:pure**, this header is blocked.  \n  \n An *asynchronous provider* stores the result of a function call. An *asynchronous return object* is used to retrieve the result of a function call. An *associated asynchronous state* provides communication between an asynchronous provider and one or more asynchronous return objects.  \n  \n A program does not directly create any associated asynchronous state objects. The program creates an asynchronous provider whenever it needs one and from that it creates an asynchronous return object that shares its associated asynchronous state with the provider. Asynchronous providers and asynchronous return objects manage the objects that hold their shared associated asynchronous state. When the last object that references the associated asynchronous state releases it, the object that holds the associated asynchronous state is destroyed.  \n  \n An asynchronous provider or an asynchronous return object that has no associated asynchronous state is *empty*.  \n  \n An associated asynchronous state is *ready* only if its asynchronous provider has stored a return value or stored an exception.  \n  \n The template function `async` and the template classes `promise` and `packaged_task` are asynchronous providers. The template classes `future` and `shared_future` describe asynchronous return objects.  \n  \n Each of the template classes `promise`, `future`, and `shared_future` has a specialization for the type `void` and a partial specialization for storing and retrieving a value by reference. These specializations differ from the primary template only in the signatures and semantics of the functions that store and retrieve the returned value.  \n  \n The template classes `future` and `shared_future` never block in their destructors, except in one case that's preserved for backward compatibility: Unlike all other futures, for a `future`—or the last `shared_future`—that's attached to a task started with `std::async`, the destructor blocks if the task has not completed; that is, it blocks if this thread did not yet call `.get()` or `.wait()` and the task is still running.
