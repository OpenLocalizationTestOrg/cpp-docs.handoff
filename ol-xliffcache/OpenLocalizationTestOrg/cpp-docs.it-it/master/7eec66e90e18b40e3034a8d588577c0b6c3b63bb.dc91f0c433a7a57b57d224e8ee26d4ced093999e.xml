When you include attributes in your source files, the compiler works with provider DLLs to insert code or modify the code in the generated object files.  \n  \n **Note:** If you are looking for C++ standard attributes, see [Attributes](../cpp/attributes2.md).  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Concepts](../windows/attributed-programming-concepts.md)  \n Describes the various concepts that are related to attributes.  \n  \n [Attributes by Group](../windows/attributes-by-group.md)  \n Provides links to attribute reference topics, grouped by function.  \n  \n [Attributes by Usage](../windows/attributes-by-usage.md)  \n Provides links to attribute reference topics, grouped by usage.  \n  \n [Attributes Alphabetical Reference](../windows/attributes-alphabetical-reference.md)  \n Provides links to all attribute reference topics.  \n  \n## Related Sections  \n [Attributed Programming](../windows/attributed-programming-concepts.md)  \n Provides a conceptual overview of attributes.  \n  \n [Reference](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/1ba03b5c-8229-4f63-b08c-6c12141d6ab1)  \n Provides links to topics describing the C and C++ language references, the libraries provided with Visual C++, the Visual C++ Extensibility Object Model, and the Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM).  \n  \n [Visual C++ Samples](../visual-cpp-samples.md)  \n Provides links to sample code showing the capabilities of Visual C++ and the libraries and technologies it supports."}
