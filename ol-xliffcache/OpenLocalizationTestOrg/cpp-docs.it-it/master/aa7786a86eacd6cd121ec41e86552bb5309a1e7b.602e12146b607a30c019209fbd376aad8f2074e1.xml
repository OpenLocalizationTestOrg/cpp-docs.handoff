The template specifies the dialog box's characteristics, including its size, location, style, and the types and positions of the dialog box's controls. You will usually use a dialog template stored as a resource, but you can also create your own template in memory.  \n  \n-   A dialog class, derived from [CDialog](../mfc/reference/cdialog-class.md), to provide a programmatic interface for managing the dialog box.  \n  \n     A dialog box is a window and will be attached to a Windows window when visible. When the dialog window is created, the dialog-template resource is used as a template for creating child window controls for the dialog box.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Dialog Boxes](../mfc/dialog-boxes.md)   \n [Life Cycle of a Dialog Box](../mfc/life-cycle-of-a-dialog-box.md)\n\n"}
