The angle brackets cannot be a macro expansion.  \n  \n## Syntax  \n  \n```  \n<<[filename]  \n```  \n  \n## Remarks  \n When the command is run, the angle brackets are replaced by *filename*, if specified, or by a unique NMAKE-generated name. If specified, *filename* must follow angle brackets without a space or tab. A path is permitted. No extension is required or assumed. If *filename* is specified, the file is created in the current or specified directory, overwriting any existing file by that name; otherwise, it is created in the TMP directory (or the current directory, if the TMP environment variable is not defined). If a previous *filename* is reused, NMAKE replaces the previous file.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Inline Files in a Makefile](../build/inline-files-in-a-makefile.md)"}
