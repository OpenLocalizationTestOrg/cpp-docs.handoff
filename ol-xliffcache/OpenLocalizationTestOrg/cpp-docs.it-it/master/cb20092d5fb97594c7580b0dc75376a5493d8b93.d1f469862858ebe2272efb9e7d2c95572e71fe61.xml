For more information, see [ODBC Driver List](../../data/odbc/odbc-driver-list.md).  \n  \n This topic introduces the main concepts of the Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) library's ODBC-based database classes and provides an overview of how the classes work together.

Because the classes use ODBC, your application can access data in many different data formats and different local/remote configurations. You do not have to write special-case code to handle different database management systems (DBMSs). As long as your users have an appropriate ODBC driver for the data they want to access, they can use your program to manipulate data in tables stored there.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Open Database Connectivity (ODBC)](../../data/odbc/open-database-connectivity-odbc.md)"}
