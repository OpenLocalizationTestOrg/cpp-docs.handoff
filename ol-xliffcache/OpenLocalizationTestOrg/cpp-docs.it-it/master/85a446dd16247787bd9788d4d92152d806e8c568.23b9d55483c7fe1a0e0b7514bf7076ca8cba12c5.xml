To distinguish between the two, the following rule is observed: The prefix form of the operator is declared exactly the same way as any other unary operator; the postfix form accepts an additional argument of type `int`.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  When specifying an overloaded operator for the postfix form of the increment or decrement operator, the additional argument must be of type `int`; specifying any other type generates an error.  \n  \n The following example shows how to define prefix and postfix increment and decrement operators for the `Point` class:  \n  \n```  \n// increment_and_decrement1.cpp  \nclass Point  \n{  \npublic:  \n   // Declare prefix and postfix increment operators.  \n   Point& operator++();       // Prefix increment operator.  \n   Point operator++(int);     // Postfix increment operator.  \n  \n   // Declare prefix and postfix decrement operators.  \n   Point& operator--();       // Prefix decrement operator.  \n   Point operator--(int);     // Postfix decrement operator.  \n  \n   // Define default constructor.  \n   Point() { _x = _y = 0; }  \n  \n   // Define accessor functions.  \n   int x() { return _x; }  \n   int y() { return _y; }  \nprivate:  \n   int _x, _y;  \n};  \n  \n// Define prefix increment operator.  \nPoint& Point::operator++()  \n{  \n   _x++;  \n   _y++;  \n   return *this;  \n}  \n  \n// Define postfix increment operator.  \nPoint Point::operator++(int)  \n{  \n   Point temp = *this;  \n   ++*this;  \n   return temp;  \n}  \n  \n// Define prefix decrement operator.  \nPoint& Point::operator--()  \n{  \n   _x--;  \n   _y--;  \n   return *this;  \n}  \n  \n// Define postfix decrement operator.  \nPoint Point::operator--(int)  \n{  \n   Point temp = *this;  \n   --*this;  \n   return temp;  \n}  \nint main()  \n{  \n}  \n```  \n  \n The same operators can be defined in file scope (globally) using the following function heads:  \n  \n```  \nfriend Point& operator++( Point& )      // Prefix increment  \nfriend Point& operator++( Point&, int ) // Postfix increment  \nfriend Point& operator--( Point& )      // Prefix decrement  \nfriend Point& operator--( Point&, int ) // Postfix decrement  \n```  \n  \n The argument of type `int` that denotes the postfix form of the increment or decrement operator is not commonly used to pass arguments. It usually contains the value 0. However, it can be used as follows:  \n  \n```  \n// increment_and_decrement2.cpp  \nclass Int  \n{  \npublic:  \n    Int &operator++( int n );  \nprivate:  \n    int _i;  \n};  \n  \nInt& Int::operator++( int n )  \n{  \n    if( n != 0 )    // Handle case where an argument is passed.  \n        _i += n;  \n    else  \n        _i++;       // Handle case where no argument is passed.  \n    return *this;  \n}  \nint main()  \n{  \n   Int i;  \n   i.operator++( 25 ); // Increment by 25.  \n}  \n```  \n  \n There is no syntax for using the increment or decrement operators to pass these values other than explicit invocation, as shown in the preceding code. A more straightforward way to implement this functionality is to overload the addition/assignment operator (`+=`).  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Operator Overloading](../cpp/operator-overloading.md)"}
