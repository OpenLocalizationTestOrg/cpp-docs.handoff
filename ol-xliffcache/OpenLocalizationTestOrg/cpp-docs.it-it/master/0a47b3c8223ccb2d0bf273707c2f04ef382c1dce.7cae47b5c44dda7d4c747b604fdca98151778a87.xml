required (ASCII or VIRTKEY)**  \n  \n     The `type` field in the **ACCELERATORS** statement must contain either the ASCII or VIRTKEY value.  \n  \n2.  **BEGIN expected in accelerator table**  \n  \n     The **BEGIN** keyword must immediately follow the **ACCELERATORS** keyword.  \n  \n3.  **BEGIN expected in dialog**  \n  \n     The **BEGIN** keyword must immediately follow the **DIALOG** keyword.  \n  \n4.  **BEGIN expected in menu**  \n  \n     The **BEGIN** keyword must immediately follow the **MENU** keyword.  \n  \n5.  **BEGIN expected in RCData**  \n  \n     The **BEGIN** keyword must immediately follow the **RCDATA** keyword.  \n  \n6.  **BEGIN keyword expected in string table**  \n  \n     The **BEGIN** keyword must immediately follow the **STRINGTABLE** keyword.  \n  \n7.  **Cannot re-use string constants**  \n  \n     You are using the same value twice in a **STRINGTABLE** statement. Make sure you are not mixing overlapping decimal and hexadecimal values. Each ID in a **STRINGTABLE** must be unique. For maximum efficiency, use contiguous constants that start on a multiple of 16.  \n  \n8.  **Control character out of range [^A - ^Z]**  \n  \n     A control character in the **ACCELERATORS** statement is invalid. The character following the caret (**^**) must be between A and Z, inclusive.  \n  \n9. **Empty menus not allowed**  \n  \n     An **END** keyword appears before any menu items are defined in the **MENU** statement. The Resource Compiler does not permit empty menus . Make sure you do not have any open quotation marks within the **MENU** statement.  \n  \n10. **END expected in dialog**  \n  \n     The **END** keyword must occur at the end of a **DIALOG** statement. Make sure there are no open quotes left from the preceding statement.  \n  \n11. **END expected in menu**  \n  \n     The **END** keyword must come at the end of a **MENU** statement.
