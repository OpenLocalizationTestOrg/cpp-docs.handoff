The easiest way to create a custom wizard is to use the [Custom Wizard](../ide/custom-wizard.md).  \n  \n> [!TIP]\n>  The Custom Wizard template is not available in Express editions.  \n  \n### To create a wizard using the Custom Wizard  \n  \n1.  Follow the instructions in the help topic [Creating a Project with a Visual C++ Application Wizard](../ide/creating-desktop-projects-by-using-application-wizards.md).  \n  \n2.  In the **New Project** dialog box, select the **Custom Wizard** icon in the **Visual C++ &#124; General** templates pane to open the Custom Wizard.  \n  \n3.  Define your [application settings](../ide/application-settings-custom-wizard.md) using the Custom Wizard.  \n  \n4.  Click **Finish** to close the wizard and open your new project in the development environment.  \n  \n After you have created your project, you can view the files created in **Solution Explorer**. For more information about the files created for the Custom Wizard, see [Files Created for Your Wizard](../ide/files-created-for-your-wizard.md).  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Designing a Wizard](../ide/designing-a-wizard.md)"}
