Panels are areas of the ribbon bar that display a group of related controls.  \n  \n In this topic, you will open the Ribbon Designer, add a button, and then link an event that displays \"Hello World\".  \n  \n### To open the Ribbon Designer  \n  \n1.  In Visual Studio, on the **View** menu, click **Resource View**.  \n  \n2.  In **Resource View**, double-click the ribbon resource to display it on the design surface.  \n  \n### To add a Button and an Event Handler  \n  \n1.  From the **Toolbar**, click **Button** and drag it on to a panel in the design surface.  \n  \n2.  Right-click the button, and click **Add Event Handler**.  \n  \n3.  In the **Event Handler Wizard**, confirm the default settings and click **Add and Edit**. For more information, see [Event Handler Wizard](../ide/event-handler-wizard.md).  \n  \n4.  In the code editor, add the following code into the handler function:  \n  \n ```  \n    MessageBox((LPCTSTR)L\"Hello World\");\n\n ```  \n  \n## See Also  \n [RibbonGadgets Sample: Ribbon Gadgets Application](../visual-cpp-samples.md)   \n [Ribbon Designer (MFC)](../mfc/ribbon-designer-mfc.md)\n\n"}
