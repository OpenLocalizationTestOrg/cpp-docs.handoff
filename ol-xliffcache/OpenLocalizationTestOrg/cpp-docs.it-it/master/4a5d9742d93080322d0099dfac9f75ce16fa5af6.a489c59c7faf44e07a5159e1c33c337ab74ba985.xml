It is not applicable to 32-bit executable images. To enable this option, /DYNAMICBASE must also be on.  \n  \n /HIGHENTROPYVA modifies the header of a .dll file or .exe file to indicate whether ASLR with 64-bit addresses is supported. When this option is set on an executable and all of the modules that it depends on, an operating system that supports 64-bit ASLR can rebase the segments of the executable image at load time by using randomized addresses in a 64-bit virtual address space. This large address space makes it more difficult for an attacker to guess the location of a particular memory region.  \n  \n### To set this linker option in Visual Studio  \n  \n1.  Open the project **Property Pages** dialog box. For more information, see [Working with Project Properties](../../ide/working-with-project-properties.md).  \n  \n2.  Expand the **Configuration Properties** node.  \n  \n3.  Expand the **Linker** node.  \n  \n4.  Select the **Command Line** property page.  \n  \n5.  In **Additional Options**, enter `/HIGHENTROPYVA` or `/HIGHENTROPYVA:NO`.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Setting Linker Options](../../build/reference/setting-linker-options.md)   \n [Linker Options](../../build/reference/linker-options.md)"}
