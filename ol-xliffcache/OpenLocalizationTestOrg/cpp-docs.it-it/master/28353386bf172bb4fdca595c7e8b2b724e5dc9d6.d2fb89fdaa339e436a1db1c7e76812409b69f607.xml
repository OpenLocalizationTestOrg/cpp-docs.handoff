To support these interfaces, the project must have been created as an ATL application or as an MFC application that contains ATL support. You can use the [ATL Project Wizard](../../atl/reference/atl-project-wizard.md) to create an ATL application, or [add an ATL object to your MFC application](../../mfc/reference/adding-atl-support-to-your-mfc-project.md) to implement ATL support for an MFC application.  \n  \n### To add an ATL control to your project  \n  \n1.  In either **Solution Explorer** or [Class View](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/8d7430a9-3e33-454c-a9e1-a85e3d2db925), right-click the name of the project to which you want to add the ATL simple object.  \n  \n2.  Click **Add** from the shortcut menu, and then click **Add Class**.  \n  \n3.  In the [Add Class](../../ide/add-class-dialog-box.md) dialog box, in the templates pane, click **ATL Control**, and then click **Add** to display the [ATL Control Wizard](../../atl/reference/atl-control-wizard.md).  \n  \n Using the **ATL Control Wizard**, you can create one of three types of controls:  \n  \n-   A standard control  \n  \n-   A composite control  \n  \n-   A DHTML control  \n  \n Additionally, you can reduce the size of the control and remove interfaces that are not used by most containers by selecting **Minimal control** on the **Options** page of the wizard.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Adding Functionality to the Composite Control](../../atl/adding-functionality-to-the-composite-control.md)   \n [Fundamentals of ATL COM Objects](../../atl/fundamentals-of-atl-com-objects.md)   \n [ATLFire Sample](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/5b2649f1-f45b-4cfb-9c4b-4d9459c26b09)\n\n"}
