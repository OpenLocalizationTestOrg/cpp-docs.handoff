Every rule contains the settings for a tool or a group of features. For example, the **Linker** rule contains the settings for the linker tool. The settings in a rule can be subdivided into *categories*.  \n  \n This document explains how to create a file in a set directory that contains properties for your custom tool so that the properties are loaded when Visual Studio starts. For information about how to modify the file, see [Platform Extensibilty Part 2](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=191489) on the Visual Studio Project Team blog.  \n  \n### To add or change project properties  \n  \n1.  In the XML editor, create an XML file.  \n  \n2.  Save the file in the %ProgramFiles%\\MSBuild\\Microsoft.Cpp\\v4.0\\ folder. Every rule in the **Property Pages** window is represented by an XML file in this folder. Make sure that the file is uniquely named in the folder.  \n  \n3.  Copy the content of %ProgramFiles%\\MSBuild\\Microsoft.Cpp\\v4.0\\cl.xml, close it without saving changes, and then paste the content in your new XML file. You can use any XML schema file – this is just one that can be used so you start with a template.  \n  \n4.  In the new XML file, modify the content according to your requirements. Make sure to change the **Rule Name** and **Rule.DisplayName** at the top of the file.  \n  \n5.  Save the changes and close the file.  \n  \n6.  The XML files in %ProgramFiles%\\MSBuild\\Microsoft.Cpp\\v4.0\\ are loaded when Visual Studio starts. Therefore, to test the new file, restart Visual Studio.  \n  \n7.  In **Solution Explorer**, right-click a project and then click **Properties**. In the **Property Pages** window, in the left pane, verify that there is a new node with the name of your Rule.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [MSBuild (Visual C++)](../build/msbuild-visual-cpp.md)"}
