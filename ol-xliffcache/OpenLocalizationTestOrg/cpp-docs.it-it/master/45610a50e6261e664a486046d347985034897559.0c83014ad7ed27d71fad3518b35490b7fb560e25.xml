Select the entire image.  \n  \n     If part of the image is currently selected, and you want to select the entire image, click anywhere on the image outside the current selection border.  \n  \n2.  Drag a sizing handle until the image is the desired size.  \n  \n Normally, the Image editor crops or enlarges an image when you resize it by moving a sizing handle. If you hold down the SHIFT key as you move a sizing handle, the Image editor [shrinks or stretches](../mfc/shrinking-or-stretching-an-entire-image-image-editor-for-icons.md) the image.  \n  \n For information on adding resources to managed projects, please see [Resources in Applications](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/8ad495d4-2941-40cf-bf64-e82e85825890) in the *.NET Framework Developer's Guide.* For information on manually adding resource files to managed projects, accessing resources, displaying static resources, and assigning resources strings to properties, see [Walkthrough: Localizing Windows Forms](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/9a96220d-a19b-4de0-9f48-01e5d82679e5) and [Walkthrough: Using Resources for Localization with ASP.NET](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/bb4e5b44-e2b0-48ab-bbe9-609fb33900b6).  \n  \n Requirements  \n  \n None  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Accelerator Keys](../mfc/accelerator-keys-image-editor-for-icons.md)   \n [Resizing an Image](../mfc/resizing-an-image-image-editor-for-icons.md)\n\n"}
