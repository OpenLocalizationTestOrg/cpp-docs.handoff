However, if you are editing an .rc file for a Windows application that is not based on MFC, the following features specific to the MFC framework are not available:  \n  \n-   MFC code wizards (previously called \"[MFC ClassWizard](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/98dc2434-ba93-4e0b-b084-1a4bc26cdf1e)\")  \n  \n-   Menu prompt strings  \n  \n-   List contents for combo box controls  \n  \n-   ActiveX control hosting  \n  \n However, you can add MFC support to existing .rc files that do not have it.  \n  \n### To add MFC support to .rc files  \n  \n1.  Open the resource script file.  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  If your project doesn't already contain an .rc file, please see [Creating a New Resource Script File](../windows/how-to-create-a-resource-script-file.md).  \n  \n2.  In [Resource View](../windows/resource-view-window.md), highlight the resources folder (for example, MFC.rc).  \n  \n3.  In the [Properties window](/visualstudio/ide/reference/properties-window), set the **MFC Mode** property to **True**.  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  In addition to setting this flag, the .rc file must be part of an MFC project. For example, just setting **MFC Mode** to **True** on an .rc file in a Win32 project won't give you any of the MFC features.  \n  \n For information on adding resources to managed projects, please see [Resources in Applications](http://msdn.microsoft.com/Library/8ad495d4-2941-40cf-bf64-e82e85825890) in the *.NET Framework Developer's Guide.* For information on manually adding resource files to managed projects, accessing resources, displaying static resources, and assigning resources strings to properties, see [Walkthrough: Using Resources for Localization with ASP.NET](http://msdn.microsoft.com/Library/bb4e5b44-e2b0-48ab-bbe9-609fb33900b6).  \n  \n **Requirements**  \n  \n MFC  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Resource Files](../mfc/resource-files-visual-studio.md)   \n [Resource Editors](../mfc/resource-editors.md)"}
