This is the default option.|  \n|**Header files only**|Provides the basic level of database support for your application. If you select ODBC support under **Client type**, the MFC Application Wizard includes in your project the header file AFXDB.H. It adds link libraries, but it does not create any database-specific classes. You can create recordsets later and use them to examine and update records. If you select OLE DB support under **Client type**, the following header files are included: ATLBASE.H AFXOLEDB.H ATLPLUS.H|  \n|**Database view without file support**|Includes database header files, link libraries, a record view and a recordset. (Available only for applications with the **Document/view architecture support** option selected in the [Application Type](../../mfc/reference/application-type-mfc-application-wizard.md) page.) This option includes document support but no serialization support. If you choose to include a database view, you must specify the source of the data.|  \n|**Database view with file support**|Includes database header files, link libraries, a record view and a recordset. (Available only for applications with the **Document/view architecture support** option selected in the **Application Type** page.) This option supports document serialization, which you can use, for example, to update a user profile file. Database applications typically operate on a per-record basis rather than on a per-file basis and so do not need serialization. However, you may have a special use for serialization. If you choose to include a database view, you must specify the source of the data.|  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  Under **Database Support**, if you select either **Database view without file support** or **Database view with file support**, the view class derivation differs, depending on your **Client type** selection, as follows:  \n  \n-   If you select **ODBC** under **Client type**, then the application's view class derives from [CRecordView](../../mfc/reference/crecordview-class.md). This class is associated with a [CRecordset](../../mfc/reference/crecordset-class.md)-derived class, which the MFC Application Wizard also creates for you. This option gives you a form-based application in which the record view is used to view and update records through its recordset.  \n  \n-   If you select **OLE DB** under **Client type**, then the view class derives from [COleDBRecordView](../../mfc/reference/coledbrecordview-class.md), and it is associated with a [CTable](../../data/oledb/ctable-class.md) or [CCommand](../../data/oledb/ccommand-class.md)-derived class.  \n  \n **Client type**  \n Indicates whether your project uses OLE DB or ODBC classes.  \n  \n|Option|Description|  \n|------------|-----------------|  \n|**OLE DB**|When this option is selected, clicking the **Data Source** button invokes the **Data Link Properties** wizard to help you create a connection to an OLE DB data source.|  \n|**ODBC**|When this option is selected, clicking the **Data Source** button invokes the **Select Data Source** wizard to help you create a connection to an ODBC data source.|  \n  \n **Data Source**  \n Click the **Data Source** button to set up a data source using the specified driver or provider and database. If you selected OLE DB in the **Client type** option, this button displays the **Data Link Properties** dialog box. If you selected ODBC in the **Client type** option, this button provides the **Select Data Source** dialog box. This option is available only if you choose to include a database view in your application.  \n  \n|Option|Description|  \n|------------|-----------------|  \n|**Data Link Properties** (OLE DB)|Establishes the specified data source using the specified OLE DB provider. You must specify the OLE DB provider, the location of the data, the data source, logon ID, and (optionally) a password. For details on this dialog box, see **Data source** in [ATL OLE DB Consumer Wizard](../../atl/reference/atl-ole-db-consumer-wizard.md).|  \n|**Select Data Source** (ODBC)|Establishes the specified data source using the specified ODBC driver. You must select a data source name to choose a table for the data source. The wizard binds all columns of the table to the member variables of a `CRecordset`-derived class. For details on this dialog box, see **Data source** in [MFC ODBC Consumer Wizard](../../mfc/reference/mfc-odbc-consumer-wizard.md).|  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  In previous releases, Shift-clicking the **Data Source** button opened a File Open dialog to allow you to select a Data Link (.udl) file. This functionality is no longer supported.  \n  \n **Generate attributed database class**  \n Available for OLE DB client only. Specifies whether the database classes in the generated project use attributes.  \n  \n **Bind all columns**  \n Available for ODBC client only. Specifies whether all columns in the selected table are bound. If you select this box, all columns are bound; if you do not select this box, no columns are bound, and you must bind them manually in the recordset class.  \n  \n **Type**  \n Available for ODBC client only. Specifies whether the recordset is a dynaset or a snapshot, as described in the following table.  \n  \n|Option|Description|  \n|------------|-----------------|  \n|**Dynaset**|Specifies that the recordset is a dynaset. A dynaset is the result of a query that provides an indexed view into the queried database's data. A dynaset caches only an integral index to the original data and thus offers a performance gain over a snapshot. The index points directly to each record found as a result of a query and indicates if a record is removed. You also have access to updated information in the queried records.|  \n|Snapshot|Specifies that the recordset is a snapshot. A snapshot is the result of a query and is a view into a database at one point in time. All records found as a result of the query are cached, so you do not see any changes to the original records.|  \n  \n## See Also  \n [MFC Application Wizard](../../mfc/reference/mfc-application-wizard.md)\n"}
