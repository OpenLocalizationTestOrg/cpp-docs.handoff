This value is stored in the <xref:System.Environment.TickCount%2A?displayProperty=fullName> member and, because it is a 32-bit value, resets to zero approximately every 24.9 days.  \n  \n## Example  \n  \n```  \n// startup_time.cpp  \n// compile with: /clr  \nusing namespace System;  \n  \nint main( )   \n{  \n   Int32 tc = Environment::TickCount;  \n   Int32 seconds = tc / 1000;  \n   Int32 minutes = seconds / 60;  \n   float hours = static_cast<float>(minutes) / 60;  \n   float days = hours / 24;  \n  \n   Console::WriteLine(\"Milliseconds since startup: {0}\", tc);  \n   Console::WriteLine(\"Seconds since startup: {0}\", seconds);  \n   Console::WriteLine(\"Minutes since startup: {0}\", minutes);  \n   Console::WriteLine(\"Hours since startup: {0}\", hours);  \n   Console::WriteLine(\"Days since startup: {0}\", days);  \n  \n   return 0;  \n}  \n```  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Windows Operations (C++/CLI)](../dotnet/windows-operations-cpp-cli.md)   \n [.NET Programming with C++/CLI (Visual C++)](../dotnet/dotnet-programming-with-cpp-cli-visual-cpp.md)"}
