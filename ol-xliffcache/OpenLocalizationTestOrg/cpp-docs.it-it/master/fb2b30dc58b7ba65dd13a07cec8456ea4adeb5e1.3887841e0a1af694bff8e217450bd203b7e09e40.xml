This is an instance of the partial ordering of function templates by the compiler. When template functions are overloaded in such a way that the match of the template with the function call is not unique, then the compiler will select the most specialized version of the template function. The general version of the template function  \n  \n `template` \\< **classT**> **void swap**( **T&**, **T&**)  \n  \n in the algorithm class works by assignment and is a slow operation.
