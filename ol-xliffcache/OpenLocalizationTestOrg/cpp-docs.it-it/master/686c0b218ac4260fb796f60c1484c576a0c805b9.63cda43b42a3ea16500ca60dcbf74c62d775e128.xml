Place the **#pragma** directive inside a block of code that is not processed when the RC_INVOKED constant is defined. Code in the block is processed only by the C/C++ compiler and not by the Resource Compiler. The following sample code demonstrates this technique:  \n  \n```  \n#ifndef RC_INVOKED  \n#pragma pack(2)  // C/C++ only, ignored by Resource Compiler  \n#endif  \n```  \n  \n The **#pragma** preprocessor directive has no meaning in an .RC file. The **#include** preprocessor directive is used frequently in an .RC file to include a header file (either a project-based custom header file or a standard header file provided by Microsoft with one of its products). Some of these include files contain the **#pragma** directive. Because a header file can include one or more other header files, the file that contains the offending **#pragma** directive may not be immediately obvious.  \n  \n The **#ifndef** RC_INVOKED technique can control including header files in project-based header files."}
