(Architecture)\n`CView` and its derived classes are child windows that represent the client area of a frame window. Views show data and accept input for a document.  \n  \n A view class is associated with a document class and a frame window class using a document-template object.  \n  \n [CView](../mfc/reference/cview-class.md)  \n The base class for application-specific views of a document's data. Views display data and accept user input to edit or select the data. Derive your view class(es) from `CView`.  \n  \n [CScrollView](../mfc/reference/cscrollview-class.md)  \n The base class for views with scrolling capabilities. Derive your view class from `CScrollView` for automatic scrolling.  \n  \n## Form and Record Views  \n Form views are also scrolling views. They are based on a dialog box template.  \n  \n Record views are derived from form views. In addition to the dialog box template, they also have a connection to a database.  \n  \n [CFormView](../mfc/reference/cformview-class.md)  \n A scroll view whose layout is defined in a dialog box template. Derive a class from `CFormView` to implement a user interface based on a dialog box template.  \n  \n [CDaoRecordView](../mfc/reference/cdaorecordview-class.md)  \n Provides a form view directly connected to a Data Access Object (DAO) recordset object. Like all form views, a `CDaoRecordView` is based on a dialog box template.  \n  \n [CHtmlView](../mfc/reference/chtmlview-class.md)  \n Supports a control for Web browsing within an application. The control supports dynamic HTML in MFC.  \n  \n [COLEDBRecordView](../mfc/reference/coledbrecordview-class.md)  \n Provides MFC OLE DB support for form views.  \n  \n [CRecordView](../mfc/reference/crecordview-class.md)  \n Provides a form view directly connected to an Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) recordset object. Like all form views, a `CRecordView` is based on a dialog box template.  \n  \n## Control Views  \n Control views display a control as their view.  \n  \n [CCtrlView](../mfc/reference/cctrlview-class.md)  \n The base class for all views associated with Windows controls. The views based on controls are described below.  \n  \n [CEditView](../mfc/reference/ceditview-class.md)  \n A view that contains a Windows standard edit control (see [CEdit](../mfc/reference/cedit-class.md)). Edit controls support text editing, searching, replacing, and scrolling capabilities.  \n  \n [CRichEditView](../mfc/reference/cricheditview-class.md)  \n A view that contains a Windows rich edit control (see [CRichEditCtrl](../mfc/reference/cricheditctrl-class.md)). In addition to the capabilities of an edit control, rich edit controls support fonts, colors, paragraph formatting, and embedded OLE objects.  \n  \n [CListView](../mfc/reference/clistview-class.md)  \n A view that contains a Windows list control (see [CListCtrl](../mfc/reference/clistctrl-class.md)). A list control displays icons and strings in a manner similar to the right pane of File Explorer.  \n  \n [CTreeView](../mfc/reference/ctreeview-class.md)  \n A view that contains a Windows tree control (see [CTreeCtrl](../mfc/reference/ctreectrl-class.md)). A tree control displays icons and strings arranged in a hierarchy in a manner similar to the left pane of File Explorer.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Class Overview](../mfc/class-library-overview.md)\n\n"}
