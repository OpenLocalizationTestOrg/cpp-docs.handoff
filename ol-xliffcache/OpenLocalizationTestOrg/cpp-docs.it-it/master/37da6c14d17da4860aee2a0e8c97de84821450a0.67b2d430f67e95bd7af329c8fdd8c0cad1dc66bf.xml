For more information, see [Creating a Makefile Project](../ide/creating-a-makefile-project.md).  \n  \n Note that Visual C++ no longer supports the ability to export a makefile for the active project from the development environment. Use [Devenv Command Line Switches](/visualstudio/ide/reference/devenv-command-line-switches) to build Visual Studio projects at the command line.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Building C++ Projects in Visual Studio](../ide/building-cpp-projects-in-visual-studio.md)"}
