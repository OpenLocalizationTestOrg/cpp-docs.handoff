The linker collects assembly information stored in the object files and combines this information into a final manifest file. By default the linker will generate a file named <binary_name>.\\<extension>.manifest to describe the final binary. The linker does not embed a manifest file inside the binary and can only generate a manifest as an external file. There are several ways to embed a manifest inside the final binary, such as using the [Manifest Tool (mt.exe)](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa375649) or compiling the manifest into a resource file. It is important to keep in mind that specific rules have to be followed when embedding a manifest inside the final binary to enable such features as incremental linking, signing, and edit and continue. These and other options are discussed in [How to: Embed a Manifest Inside a C/C++ Application](../build/how-to-embed-a-manifest-inside-a-c-cpp-application.md) when building on the command line.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Manifests](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa375365)   \n [/INCREMENTAL (Link Incrementally)](../build/reference/incremental-link-incrementally.md)   \n [Strong Name Assemblies (Assembly Signing) (C++/CLI)](../dotnet/strong-name-assemblies-assembly-signing-cpp-cli.md)   \n [Edit and Continue](/visualstudio/debugger/edit-and-continue)   \n [Understanding Manifest Generation for C/C++ Programs](../build/understanding-manifest-generation-for-c-cpp-programs.md)"}
