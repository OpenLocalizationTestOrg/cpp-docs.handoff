The ANSI C syntax labels these components tokens.  \n  \n This section explains how to define tokens and how the compiler evaluates them.  \n  \n The following topics are discussed:  \n  \n-   [Tokens](../c-language/c-tokens.md)  \n  \n-   [Comments](../c-language/c-comments.md)  \n  \n-   [Keywords](../c-language/c-keywords.md)  \n  \n-   [Identifiers](../c-language/c-identifiers.md)  \n  \n-   [Constants](../c-language/c-constants.md)  \n  \n-   [String literals](../c-language/c-string-literals.md)  \n  \n-   [Punctuation and special characters](../c-language/punctuation-and-special-characters.md)  \n  \n The section also includes reference tables for [Trigraphs](../c-language/trigraphs.md), [Limits on Floating-Point Constants](../c-language/limits-on-floating-point-constants.md), [C++ Integer Limits](../c-language/cpp-integer-limits.md), and [Escape Sequences](../c-language/escape-sequences.md).  \n  \n Operators are symbols (both single characters and character combinations) that specify how values are to be manipulated. Each symbol is interpreted as a single unit, called a token.
