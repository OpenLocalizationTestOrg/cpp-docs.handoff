These routines automate many common programming tasks that are not provided by the C and C++ languages.  \n  \n Sample programs are included in the individual reference topics for most routines in the library.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [C Run-Time Libraries](../c-runtime-library/crt-library-features.md)  \n Discusses the .lib files that comprise the C run-time libraries.  \n  \n [Run-Time Routines by Category](../c-runtime-library/run-time-routines-by-category.md)  \n Provides links to the run-time library by category.  \n  \n [Global Variables and Standard Types](../c-runtime-library/global-variables-and-standard-types.md)  \n Provides links to the global variables and standard types provided by the run-time library.  \n  \n [Global Constants](../c-runtime-library/global-constants.md)  \n Provides links to the global constants defined by the run-time library.  \n  \n [Alphabetical Function Reference](../c-runtime-library/reference/crt-alphabetical-function-reference.md)  \n Provides a table of contents entry point into an alphabetical listing of all C run-time library functions.  \n  \n [Generic-Text Mappings](../c-runtime-library/generic-text-mappings.md)  \n Provides links to the generic-text mappings defined in Tchar.h.  \n  \n [Language and Country/Region Strings](../c-runtime-library/locale-names-languages-and-country-region-strings.md)  \n Describes how to use the `setlocale` function to set the language and Country/Region strings.  \n  \n## Related Sections  \n [Debug Routines](../c-runtime-library/debug-routines.md)  \n Provides links to the debug versions of the run-time library routines.  \n  \n [Run-Time Error Checking](../c-runtime-library/run-time-error-checking.md)  \n Provides links to functions that support run-time error checks.  \n  \n [Run-Time Library Behavior](../build/run-time-library-behavior.md)  \n Discusses the entry point into the CRT DLL.  \n  \n [Visual C++ Libraries](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/fec23c40-10c0-4857-9cdc-33a3b99b30ae)  \n Provides links to the various libraries provided with Visual C++, including ATL, MFC, OLE DB Templates, the C run-time library, and the Standard C++ Library.  \n  \n [Debugging](/visualstudio/debugger/debugging-in-visual-studio)  \n Provides links to using the Visual Studio debugger to correct logic errors in your application or stored procedures.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Visual C++ Libraries Reference](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/fec23c40-10c0-4857-9cdc-33a3b99b30ae)"}
