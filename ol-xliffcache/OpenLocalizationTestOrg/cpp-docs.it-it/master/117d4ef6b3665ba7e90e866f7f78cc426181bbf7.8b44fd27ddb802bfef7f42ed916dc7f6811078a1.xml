elements contained need not be unique and in which they serve as the key values according to which the data is automatically ordered. The key value of an element in a multiset may not be changed directly. Instead, old values must be deleted and elements with new values inserted.  \n  \n## Syntax  \n  \n```  \ntemplate <class Key, class Compare =less <Key>, class Allocator =allocator <Key>>  \nclass multiset  \n```  \n  \n#### Parameters  \n *Key*  \n The element data type to be stored in the multiset.  \n  \n *Compare*  \n The type that provides a function object that can compare two element values as sort keys to determine their relative order in the multiset. The binary predicate **less**\\<Key> is the default value.  \n  \n In C++14 you can enable heterogeneous lookup by specifying the `std::less<>` or `std::greater<>` predicate that has no type parameters. For more information, see [Heterogeneous Lookup in Associative Containers](../standard-library/stl-containers.md#sequence_containers)  \n  \n `Allocator`  \n The type that represents the stored allocator object that encapsulates details about the multiset's allocation and deallocation of memory. The default value is **allocator***\\<Key>.*  \n  \n## Remarks  \n The STL multiset class is:  \n  \n-   An associative container, which is a variable size container that supports the efficient retrieval of element values based on an associated key value.  \n  \n-   Reversible, because it provides bidirectional iterators to access its elements.  \n  \n-   Sorted, because its elements are ordered by key values within the container in accordance with a specified comparison function.  \n  \n-   Multiple in the sense that its elements do not need to have unique keys, so that one key value can have many element values associated with it.  \n  \n-   A simple associative container because its element values are its key values.  \n  \n-   A template class, because the functionality it provides is generic and so independent of the specific type of data contained as elements. The data type to be used is, instead, specified as a parameter in the class template along with the comparison function and allocator.  \n  \n The iterator provided by the multiset class is a bidirectional iterator, but the class member functions [insert](#multiset__insert) and [multiset](#multiset__multiset) have versions that take as template parameters a weaker input iterator, whose functionality requirements are more minimal than those guaranteed by the class of bidirectional iterators. The different iterator concepts form a family related by refinements in their functionality. Each iterator concept has its own set of requirements and the algorithms that work with them must limit their assumptions to the requirements provided by that type of iterator. It may be assumed that an input iterator may be dereferenced to refer to some object and that it may be incremented to the next iterator in the sequence. This is a minimal set of functionality, but it is enough to be able to talk meaningfully about a range of iterators [ `First`, `Last`) in the context of the class's member functions.  \n  \n The choice of container type should be based in general on the type of searching and inserting required by the application. Associative containers are optimized for the operations of lookup, insertion and removal. The member functions that explicitly support these operations are efficient, performing them in a time that is on average proportional to the logarithm of the number of elements in the container. Inserting elements invalidates no iterators, and removing elements invalidates only those iterators that had specifically pointed at the removed elements.  \n  \n The multiset should be the associative container of choice when the conditions associating the values with their keys are satisfies by the application. The elements of a multiset may be multiple and serve as their own sort keys, so keys are not unique. A model for this type of structure is an ordered list of, say, words in which the words may occur more than once. Had multiple occurrences of the words not been allowed, then a set would have been the appropriate container structure. If unique definitions were attached as values to the list of unique key words, then a map would be an appropriate structure to contain this data. If instead the definitions were not unique, then a multimap would be the container of choice.  \n  \n The multiset orders the sequence it controls by calling a stored function object of type `Compare`. This stored object is a comparison function that may be accessed by calling the member function [key_comp](#multiset__key_comp). In general, the elements need be merely less than comparable to establish this order: so that, given any two elements, it may be determined either that they are equivalent (in the sense that neither is less than the other) or that one is less than the other. This results in an ordering between the nonequivalent elements. On a more technical note, the comparison function is a binary predicate that induces a strict weak ordering in the standard mathematical sense. A binary predicate *f*( *x*, *y*) is a function object that has two argument objects *x* and *y* and a return value of **true** or **false**. An ordering imposed on a set is a strict weak ordering if the binary predicate is irreflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive and if equivalence is transitive, where two objects x and y are defined to be equivalent when both *f*( *x,y*) and *f*( *y,x*) are false. If the stronger condition of equality between keys replaces that of equivalence, then the ordering becomes total (in the sense that all the elements are ordered with respect to each other) and the keys matched will be indiscernible from each other.  \n  \n In C++14 you can enable heterogeneous lookup by specifying the `std::less<>` or `std::greater<>` predicate that has no type parameters.

The container member function `end()` refers to the position just after the last element in the container—for example, the statement `s.insert(v.begin(), v.end());` inserts all elements of `v` into `s`.  \n  \n The initializer list member function (6) uses an [initializer_list](../standard-library/initializer-list.md) to copy elements into the multiset.  \n  \n For insertion of an element constructed in place—that is, no copy or move operations are performed—see [multiset::emplace](#multiset__emplace) and [multiset::emplace_hint](#multiset__emplace_hint).  \n  \n### Example  \n  \n```cpp  \n  \n// multiset_insert.cpp  \n// compile with: /EHsc  \n#include <set>  \n#include <iostream>  \n#include <string>  \n#include <vector>  \n  \nusing namespace std;  \n  \ntemplate <typename S> void print(const S& s) {  \n    cout << s.size() << \" elements: \";  \n  \n    for (const auto& p : s) {  \n        cout << \"(\" << p << \") \";  \n    }  \n  \n    cout << endl;  \n}  \n  \nint main()  \n{  \n  \n    // insert single values   \n    multiset<int> s1;  \n    // call insert(const value_type&) version  \n    s1.insert({ 1, 10 });  \n    // call insert(ValTy&&) version   \n    s1.insert(20);  \n  \n    cout << \"The original multiset values of s1 are:\" << endl;  \n    print(s1);  \n  \n    // intentionally attempt a duplicate, single element  \n    s1.insert(1);  \n    cout << \"The modified multiset values of s1 are:\" << endl;  \n    print(s1);  \n    cout << endl;  \n  \n    // single element, with hint  \n    s1.insert(s1.end(), 30);  \n    cout << \"The modified multiset values of s1 are:\" << endl;  \n    print(s1);  \n    cout << endl;  \n  \n    // The templatized version inserting a jumbled range  \n    multiset<int> s2;  \n    vector<int> v;  \n    v.push_back(43);  \n    v.push_back(294);  \n    v.push_back(41);  \n    v.push_back(330);  \n    v.push_back(42);  \n    v.push_back(45);  \n  \n    cout << \"Inserting the following vector data into s2:\" << endl;  \n    print(v);  \n  \n    s2.insert(v.begin(), v.end());  \n  \n    cout << \"The modified multiset values of s2 are:\" << endl;  \n    print(s2);  \n    cout << endl;  \n  \n    // The templatized versions move-constructing elements  \n    multiset<string>  s3;  \n    string str1(\"blue\"), str2(\"green\");  \n  \n    // single element  \n    s3.insert(move(str1));  \n    cout << \"After the first move insertion, s3 contains:\" << endl;  \n    print(s3);  \n  \n    // single element with hint  \n    s3.insert(s3.end(), move(str2));  \n    cout << \"After the second move insertion, s3 contains:\" << endl;  \n    print(s3);  \n    cout << endl;  \n  \n    multiset<int> s4;  \n    // Insert the elements from an initializer_list  \n    s4.insert({ 4, 44, 2, 22, 3, 33, 1, 11, 5, 55 });  \n    cout << \"After initializer_list insertion, s4 contains:\" << endl;  \n    print(s4);  \n    cout << endl;  \n}  \n  \n```  \n  \n##  <a name=\"multiset__iterator\"></a>  multiset::iterator  \n A type that provides a constant [bidirectional iterator](../standard-library/bidirectional-iterator-tag-struct.md) that can read any element in a multiset.  \n  \n```  \ntypedef implementation-defined iterator;  \n```  \n  \n### Example  \n  See the example for [begin](#multiset__begin) for an example of how to declare and use an **iterator**.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"multiset__key_comp\"></a>  multiset::key_comp  \n Retrieves a copy of the comparison object used to order keys in a multiset.  \n  \n```  \nkey_compare key_comp() const;\n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Returns the function object that a multiset uses to order its elements, which is the template parameter `Compare`.  \n  \n For more information on `Compare`, see the Remarks section of the [multiset Class](../standard-library/multiset-class.md) topic.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The stored object defines the member function:  \n  \n **bool operator**( **const Key&** *x*, **const Key&** *y*);  \n  \n which returns true if *x* strictly precedes *y* in the sort order.  \n  \n Note that both [key_compare](#multiset__key_compare) and [value_compare](#multiset__value_compare) are synonyms for the template parameter `Compare`.
