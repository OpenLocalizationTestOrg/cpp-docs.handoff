After you finish modifying the composite control, click **Build Solution** or **Rebuild Solution** from the **Build** menu. Once the project successfully builds, load the HTML page, located in the root directory of your composite control project, into Internet Explorer or another browser and test the functionality of your control.  \n  \n You can also test your composite control using the Test Container tool, or any other application that can host an ActiveX control. See [Testing Properties and Events with Test Container](../mfc/testing-properties-and-events-with-test-container.md) for information on how to access the test container.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Composite Control Fundamentals](../atl/atl-composite-control-fundamentals.md)\n\n"}
