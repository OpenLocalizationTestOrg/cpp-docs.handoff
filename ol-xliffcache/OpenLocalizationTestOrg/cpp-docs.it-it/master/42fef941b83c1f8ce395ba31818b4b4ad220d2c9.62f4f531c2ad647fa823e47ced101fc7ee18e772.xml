Further, you can generally mix calls to the class library freely with direct calls to the Windows API. This direct access does not, however, imply that the classes are a complete replacement for that API. Developers must still occasionally make direct calls to some Windows functions, such as [SetCursor](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms648393) and [GetSystemMetrics](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms724385), for example. A Windows function is wrapped by a class member function only when there is a clear advantage to doing so.  \n  \n Because you sometimes need to make native Windows function calls, you should have access to the C-language Windows API documentation. This documentation is included with Microsoft Visual C++.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  For an overview of how the MFC Library framework operates, see [Using the Classes to Write Applications for Windows](../mfc/using-the-classes-to-write-applications-for-windows.md).  \n  \n## See Also  \n [General Class Design Philosophy](../mfc/general-class-design-philosophy.md)\n"}
