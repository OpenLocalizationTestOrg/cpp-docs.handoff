To do this, include the **noFlickerActivate** flag in the set of flags returned by [COleControl::GetControlFlags](../mfc/reference/colecontrol-class.md#colecontrol__getcontrolflags). For example:  \n  \n [!code-cpp[NVC_MFC_AxOpt#5](../mfc/codesnippet/cpp/providing-flicker-free-activation_1.cpp)]  \n[!code-cpp[NVC_MFC_AxOpt#13](../mfc/codesnippet/cpp/providing-flicker-free-activation_2.cpp)]  \n[!code-cpp[NVC_MFC_AxOpt#7](../mfc/codesnippet/cpp/providing-flicker-free-activation_3.cpp)]  \n  \n The code to include this flag is automatically generated if you select the **Flicker-Free activation** option on the [Control Settings](../mfc/reference/control-settings-mfc-activex-control-wizard.md) page when creating your control with the MFC ActiveX Control Wizard.  \n  \n If you are using windowless activation, this optimization has no effect.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [MFC ActiveX Controls: Optimization](../mfc/mfc-activex-controls-optimization.md)\n\n"}
