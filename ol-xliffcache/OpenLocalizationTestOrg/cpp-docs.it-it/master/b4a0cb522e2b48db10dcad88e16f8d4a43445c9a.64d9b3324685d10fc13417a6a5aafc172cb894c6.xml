This value is returned by many run-time math functions when an error occurs. For some functions, –`HUGE_VAL` is returned. `HUGE_VAL` is defined as `_HUGE`, but run-time math functions return `HUGE_VAL`. You should also use `HUGE_VAL` in your code for consistency.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Global Constants](../c-runtime-library/global-constants.md)"}
