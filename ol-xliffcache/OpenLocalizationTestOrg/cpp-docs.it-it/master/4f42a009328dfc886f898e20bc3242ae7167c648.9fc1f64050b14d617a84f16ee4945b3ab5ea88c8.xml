From the **File** menu, click **Open**.  \n  \n2.  In the **Files of Type** box, click **All Files**.  \n  \n3.  Locate and open the image you want to edit.  \n  \n For information on adding resources to managed projects, please see [Resources in Applications](http://msdn.microsoft.com/Library/8ad495d4-2941-40cf-bf64-e82e85825890) in the *.NET Framework Developer's Guide.* For information on manually adding resource files to managed projects, accessing resources, displaying static resources, and assigning resources strings to properties, see [Walkthrough: Localizing Windows Forms](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/9a96220d-a19b-4de0-9f48-01e5d82679e5) and [Walkthrough: Using Resources for Localization with ASP.NET](http://msdn.microsoft.com/Library/bb4e5b44-e2b0-48ab-bbe9-609fb33900b6).  \n  \n Requirements  \n  \n None  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Editing Graphical Resources](../mfc/editing-graphical-resources-image-editor-for-icons.md)   \n [Image Editor for Icons](../mfc/image-editor-for-icons.md)\n\n"}
