# Resource Compiler Fatal Error RW1025
Out of far heap memory  
  
 Check for memory-resident software that might be taking up too much space. Use the CHKDSK program to find out how much memory you have.  
  
 If you are creating a large resource file, split the resource script into two files. After creating two .res files, use the MS-DOS command line to join them together:  
  
```  
copy first.res /b + second.res /b full.res  
```
