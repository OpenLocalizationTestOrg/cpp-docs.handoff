If your **WINVER** or **_WIN32_WINNT** macros are assigned to one of these versions of Windows, you must modify the macros. When you upgrade a project that was created by using an earlier version of Visual C++, you may see compilation errors related to the **WINVER** or **_WIN32_WINNT** macros if they are assigned to a version of Windows that is no longer supported.  \n  \n## Remarks  \n To modify the macros, in a header file (for example, targetver.h which is included when you create a project that targets Windows), add the following lines.  \n  \n```  \n#define WINVER 0x0A00  \n#define _WIN32_WINNT 0x0A00  \n```  \n  \n This targets the Windows 10 operating system. These values are listed in the Windows header file SDKDDKVer.h, which also defines macros for each Windows version. You should add the #define statement before including SDKDDKVer.h. Here are the lines from the Windows 10 version of SDKDDKVer.h that encode the values for each version of Windows:  \n  \n```  \n//  \n// _WIN32_WINNT version constants  \n//  \n#define _WIN32_WINNT_NT4                    0x0400 // Windows NT 4.0  \n#define _WIN32_WINNT_WIN2K                  0x0500 // Windows 2000  \n#define _WIN32_WINNT_WINXP                  0x0501 // Windows XP  \n#define _WIN32_WINNT_WS03                   0x0502 // Windows Server 2003  \n#define _WIN32_WINNT_WIN6                   0x0600 // Windows Vista  \n#define _WIN32_WINNT_VISTA                  0x0600 // Windows Vista  \n#define _WIN32_WINNT_WS08                   0x0600 // Windows Server 2008  \n#define _WIN32_WINNT_LONGHORN               0x0600 // Windows Vista  \n#define _WIN32_WINNT_WIN7                   0x0601 // Windows 7  \n#define _WIN32_WINNT_WIN8                   0x0602 // Windows 8  \n#define _WIN32_WINNT_WINBLUE                0x0603 // Windows 8.1  \n#define _WIN32_WINNT_WINTHRESHOLD           0x0A00 // Windows 10  \n#define _WIN32_WINNT_WIN10                  0x0A00 // Windows 10  \n```  \n  \n If you don't see all of these versions of Windows listed in a copy of SDKDDKVer.h that you're looking at, you probably are using an older version of the Windows SDK. By default, Win32 projects in [!INCLUDE[vs_dev14](../ide/includes/vs_dev14_md.md)] use the Windows 8.1 SDK. To use the Windows 10 SDK, see [How to: Use the Windows 10 SDK in a Windows Desktop Application](../windows/how-to-use-the-windows-10-sdk-in-a-windows-desktop-application.md).  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  Values are not guaranteed to work if you include internal MFC headers in your application.  \n  \n You can also define this macro by using the **/D** compiler option. For more information, see [/D (Preprocessor Definitions)](../build/reference/d-preprocessor-definitions.md).  \n  \n For more information about the meanings of these macros, see [Using the Windows Headers](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa383745).  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Previous Product Changes](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/91fa1713-0778-4b6b-82f7-0fe0a23ab1db)"}
