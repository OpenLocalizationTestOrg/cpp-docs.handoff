This adds the specifications for that control type to the dialog-template resource. When you construct a dialog object and call its **Create** or `DoModal` member function, the framework creates a Windows control and places it in the dialog window on screen.  \n  \n You can instead [create controls by hand](../mfc/adding-controls-by-hand.md) if you want. This is more work.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Making and Using Controls](../mfc/making-and-using-controls.md)   \n [Controls](../mfc/controls-mfc.md)\n\n"}
