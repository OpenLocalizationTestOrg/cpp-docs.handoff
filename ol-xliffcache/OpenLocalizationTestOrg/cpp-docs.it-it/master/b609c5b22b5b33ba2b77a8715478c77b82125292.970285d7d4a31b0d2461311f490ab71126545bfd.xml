ATL provides built-in support for many of the fundamental COM interfaces.  \n  \n ATL is shipped as source code which you include in your application. ATL also makes a DLL available (atl90.dll), which contains code that can be shared across components. However, this DLL is not necessary.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Introduction to ATL](../atl/introduction-to-atl.md)   \n [ATL Project Wizard](../atl/reference/atl-project-wizard.md)\n\n"}
