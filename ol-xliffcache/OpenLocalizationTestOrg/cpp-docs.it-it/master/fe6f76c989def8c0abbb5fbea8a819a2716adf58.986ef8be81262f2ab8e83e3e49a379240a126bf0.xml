controls to jump to their handler code or to quickly create stub handler functions.  \n  \n With a control selected, click the **ControlEvents** button or the **Messages** button in the [Properties window](/visualstudio/ide/reference/properties-window) to view a complete list of Windows messages and events available for the selected item. Choose from the list to create or edit handler functions.  \n  \n### To jump to code from the dialog editor  \n  \n1.  Double-click on a control within the dialog box to jump to the declaration for its most-recently implemented message handling function. (For ATL-based dialog classes, you always jump to the constructor definition.)  \n  \n### To view events for a control  \n  \n1.  With a control selected, click the **ControlEvents** button in the [Properties window](/visualstudio/ide/reference/properties-window).  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  Clicking the **ControlEvents** button when the *dialog box* has focus exposes a list of all the controls in the dialog box, which you can then expand to edit the events for the individual controls.  \n  \n     When a single control has focus in the dialog box, you can right-click it and select **Add Event Handler** from the shortcut menu. This enables you to specify the class to which the handler is added. For more information, see [Adding an Event Handler](../ide/adding-an-event-handler-visual-cpp.md).  \n  \n### To view messages for a dialog box  \n  \n1.  With the dialog box selected, click the **Messages** button in the [Properties window](/visualstudio/ide/reference/properties-window).  \n  \n For information on adding resources to managed projects, please see [Resources in Applications](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/8ad495d4-2941-40cf-bf64-e82e85825890) in the *.NET Framework Developer's Guide.* For information on manually adding resource files to managed projects, accessing resources, displaying static resources, and assigning resources strings to properties, see [Walkthrough: Localizing Windows Forms](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/9a96220d-a19b-4de0-9f48-01e5d82679e5) and [Walkthrough: Using Resources for Localization with ASP.NET](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/bb4e5b44-e2b0-48ab-bbe9-609fb33900b6).  \n  \n Requirements  \n  \n Win32  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Dialog Editor](../mfc/dialog-editor.md)\n\n"}
