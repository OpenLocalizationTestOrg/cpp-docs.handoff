# Compiler Error C2834
'operator operator' must be globally qualified  
  
 The `new` and `delete` operators are tied to the class where they reside. Scope resolution cannot be used to select a version of `new` or `delete` from a different class. To implement multiple forms of the `new` or `delete` operator, create a version of the operator with extra formal parameters.
