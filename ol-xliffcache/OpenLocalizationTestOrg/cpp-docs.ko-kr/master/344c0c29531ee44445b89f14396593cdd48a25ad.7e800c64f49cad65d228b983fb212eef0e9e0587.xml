The three most important input stream classes are [istream](../standard-library/basic-istream-class.md), [ifstream](../standard-library/basic-ifstream-class.md), and [istringstream](../standard-library/basic-istringstream-class.md).  \n  \n The `istream` class is best used for sequential text-mode input. You can configure objects of class `istream` for buffered or unbuffered operation. All functionality of the base class, `ios`, is included in `istream`. You will rarely construct objects from class `istream`. Instead, you will generally use the predefined `cin` object, which is actually an object of class [ostream](../standard-library/basic-ostream-class.md). In some cases, you can assign `cin` to other stream objects after program startup.  \n  \n The `ifstream` class supports disk file input. If you need an input-only disk file, construct an object of class `ifstream`. You can specify binary or text-mode data. If you specify a filename in the constructor, the file is automatically opened when the object is constructed. Otherwise, you can use the `open` function after invoking the default constructor. Many formatting options and member functions apply to `ifstream` objects. All functionality of the base classes `ios` and `istream` is included in `ifstream`.  \n  \n Like the library function `sscanf_s`, the `istringstream` class supports input from in-memory strings. To extract data from a character array that has a null terminator, allocate and initialize the string, then construct an object of class `istringstream`.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Constructing Input Stream Objects](../standard-library/constructing-input-stream-objects.md)  \n  \n [Using Extraction Operators](../standard-library/using-extraction-operators.md)  \n  \n [Testing for Extraction Errors](../standard-library/testing-for-extraction-errors.md)  \n  \n [Input Stream Manipulators](../standard-library/input-stream-manipulators.md)  \n  \n [Input Stream Member Functions](../standard-library/input-stream-member-functions.md)  \n  \n [Overloading the >> Operator for Your Own Classes](../standard-library/overloading-the-input-operator-for-your-own-classes.md)  \n  \n## See Also  \n [iostream Programming](../standard-library/iostream-programming.md)\n"}
