The default guides are the margins, which can be moved by dragging. Click in the rulers to place a guide. Controls \"snap\" to guides when the controls are moved over or next to them. Controls also move with a guide once they are attached to it. When a control is attached to a guide on each side, and a guide is moved, the control is resized.  \n  \n **Grid**  \n  \n Creates a layout grid. New controls will automatically align to the grid.  \n  \n## Grid spacing  \n Displays the settings for the grid spacing in dialog box units (DLUs).  \n  \n **Width: DLUs**  \n  \n Sets the width of the layout grid in DLUs. A horizontal DLU is the average width of the dialog box font divided by four.  \n  \n **Height: DLUs**  \n  \n Sets the height of the layout grid in DLUs. A vertical DLU is the average height of the dialog box font divided by eight.  \n  \n For information on adding resources to managed projects, please see [Resources in Applications](http://msdn.microsoft.com/Library/8ad495d4-2941-40cf-bf64-e82e85825890) in the *.NET Framework Developer's Guide.* For information on manually adding resource files to managed projects, accessing resources, displaying static resources, and assigning resources strings to properties, see [Walkthrough: Localizing Windows Forms](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/9a96220d-a19b-4de0-9f48-01e5d82679e5) and [Walkthrough: Using Resources for Localization with ASP.NET](http://msdn.microsoft.com/Library/bb4e5b44-e2b0-48ab-bbe9-609fb33900b6).  \n  \n## Requirements  \n Win32  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Modifying the Layout Grid](../mfc/modifying-the-layout-grid.md)   \n [Dialog Editor States (Guides and Grids)](../mfc/dialog-editor-states-guides-and-grids.md)\n\n"}
