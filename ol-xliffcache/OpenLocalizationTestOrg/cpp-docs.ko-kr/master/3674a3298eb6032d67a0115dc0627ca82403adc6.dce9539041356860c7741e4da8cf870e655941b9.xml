Open a version information resource by double-clicking it in [Resource View](../windows/resource-view-window.md).  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  If your project doesn't already contain an .rc file, please see [Creating a New Resource Script File](../windows/how-to-create-a-resource-script-file.md).  \n  \n2.  Right-click within the version information table and choose **New Version Info Block** from the shortcut menu.  \n  \n     This command adds an additional information block to the current version information resource and opens its corresponding properties in the [Properties window](/visualstudio/ide/reference/properties-window).  \n  \n3.  In the **Properties** window, choose the appropriate language and character set for your new block.  \n  \n For information on adding resources to managed projects, please see [Resources in Applications](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/8ad495d4-2941-40cf-bf64-e82e85825890) in the *.NET Framework Developer's Guide.* For information on manually adding resource files to managed projects, accessing resources, displaying static resources, and assigning resources strings to properties, see [Walkthrough: Localizing Windows Forms](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/9a96220d-a19b-4de0-9f48-01e5d82679e5) and [Walkthrough: Using Resources for Localization with ASP.NET](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/bb4e5b44-e2b0-48ab-bbe9-609fb33900b6).  \n  \n **Requirements**  \n  \n Win32  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Version Information Editor](../mfc/version-information-editor.md)   \n [Version Information (Windows)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms646981.aspx)\n\n"}
