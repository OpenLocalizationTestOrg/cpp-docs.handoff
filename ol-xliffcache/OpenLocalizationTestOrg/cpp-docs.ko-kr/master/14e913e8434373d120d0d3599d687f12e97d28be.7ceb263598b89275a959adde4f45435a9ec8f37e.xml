First, the user can create a new, empty document with the File New command. In that case, initialize the document in your override of the [OnNewDocument](../mfc/reference/cdocument-class.md#cdocument__onnewdocument) member function of class [CDocument](../mfc/reference/cdocument-class.md). Second, the user can use the Open command on the File menu to create a new document whose contents are read from a file. In that case, initialize the document in your override of the [OnOpenDocument](../mfc/reference/cdocument-class.md#cdocument__onopendocument) member function of class **CDocument**. If both initializations are the same, you can call a common member function from both overrides, or `OnOpenDocument` can call `OnNewDocument` to initialize a clean document and then finish the open operation.  \n  \n Views are created after their documents are created. The best time to initialize a view is after the framework has finished creating the document, frame window, and view. You can initialize your view by overriding the [OnInitialUpdate](../mfc/reference/cview-class.md#cview__oninitialupdate) member function of [CView](../mfc/reference/cview-class.md). If you need to reinitialize or adjust anything each time the document changes, you can override [OnUpdate](../mfc/reference/cview-class.md#cview__onupdate).  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Initializing and Cleaning Up Documents and Views](../mfc/initializing-and-cleaning-up-documents-and-views.md)\n\n"}
