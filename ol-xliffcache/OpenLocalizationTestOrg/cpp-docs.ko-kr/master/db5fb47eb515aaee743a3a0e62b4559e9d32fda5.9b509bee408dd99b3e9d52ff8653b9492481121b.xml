The sole purpose of the termination handler should be to ensure that resources, such as memory, handles, and files, are properly closed regardless of how a section of code finishes executing.  \n  \n Termination handlers use the try-finally statement.  \n  \n## What do you want to know more about?  \n  \n-   [The try-finally statement](../cpp/try-finally-statement.md)  \n  \n-   [Cleaning up resources](../cpp/cleaning-up-resources.md)  \n  \n-   [Timing of actions in exception handling](../cpp/timing-of-exception-handling-a-summary.md)  \n  \n-   [Restrictions on termination handlers](../cpp/restrictions-on-termination-handlers.md)  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Structured Exception Handling (C/C++)](../cpp/structured-exception-handling-c-cpp.md)"}
