A connectable object (that is, a source) can expose a connection point for its own interfaces or for any outgoing interface. Visual C++ and Windows both provide type libraries that have outgoing interfaces. Each outgoing interface can be implemented by a client on an object (that is, a sink).  \n  \n For more information, see [ATL Connection Points](../atl/atl-connection-points.md).  \n  \n **Available type libraries**  \n Displays the available type libraries containing the interface definitions for which you can implement connection points. Click the ellipsis button to locate a file containing the type library to use.  \n  \n **Location**  \n Displays the location of the type library currently selected in the **Available type libraries** list.  \n  \n **Interfaces**  \n Displays the interfaces whose definitions are contained in the type library currently selected in the **Available type libraries** box.  \n  \n|Transfer button|Description|  \n|---------------------|-----------------|  \n|**>**|Adds to the **Implement connection points** list the interface name currently selected in the **Interfaces** list.|  \n|**>>**|Adds to the **Implement connection points** list all interface names available in the **Interfaces** list.|  \n|**<**|Removes the interface name currently selected in the **Implement connection points** list.|  \n|**<<**|Removes all interface names currently listed in the **Implement connection points** list.|  \n  \n **Implement connection points**  \n Displays the names of the interfaces for which you implement connection points when you click **Finish**.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Implementing a Connection Point](../ide/implementing-a-connection-point-visual-cpp.md)"}
