Nested include files are also displayed (files that are included from the files that you include).  \n  \n## Syntax  \n  \n```  \n/showIncludes  \n```  \n  \n## Remarks  \n When an include file is encountered during compilation, a message is output, for example:  \n  \n```  \nNote: including file: d:\\MyDir\\include\\stdio.h  \n```  \n  \n Nested include files are indicated by an indentation, one space for each level of nesting, for example:  \n  \n```  \nNote: including file: d:\\temp\\1.h  \nNote: including file:  d:\\temp\\2.h  \n```  \n  \n In this case, `2.h` was included from within `1.h`, hence the indentation.  \n  \n The **/showIncludes** option emits to `stderr`, not `stdout`.  \n  \n### To set this compiler option in the Visual Studio development environment  \n  \n1.  Open the project's **Property Pages** dialog box. For details, see [Working with Project Properties](../../ide/working-with-project-properties.md).  \n  \n2.  Click the **C/C++** folder.  \n  \n3.  Click the **Advanced** property page.  \n  \n4.  Modify the **Show Includes** property.  \n  \n### To set this compiler option programmatically  \n  \n-   See <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.VCProjectEngine.VCCLCompilerTool.ShowIncludes%2A>.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Compiler Options](../../build/reference/compiler-options.md)   \n [Setting Compiler Options](../../build/reference/setting-compiler-options.md)"}
