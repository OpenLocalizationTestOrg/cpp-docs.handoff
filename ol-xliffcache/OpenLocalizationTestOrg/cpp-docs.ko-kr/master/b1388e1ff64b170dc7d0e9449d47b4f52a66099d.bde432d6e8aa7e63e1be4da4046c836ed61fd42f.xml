state of variables and objects.  \n  \n In this walkthrough, you watch the value of a variable as the program runs and deduce why the value is not what you expect.  \n  \n## Prerequisites  \n  \n-   This walkthrough assumes that you understand the fundamentals of the C++ language.  \n  \n-   It also assumes that you have completed the earlier related walkthroughs that are listed in [Using the Visual Studio IDE for C++ Desktop Development](../ide/using-the-visual-studio-ide-for-cpp-desktop-development.md).  \n  \n### To run a program in Debug mode  \n  \n1.  Open TestGames.cpp for editing.  \n  \n2.  Select this line of code:  \n  \n     `Cardgame.solitaire(1);`  \n  \n3.  To set a breakpoint on that line, on the menu bar, choose **Debug**, **Toggle Breakpoint**, or choose the F9 key. A red circle appears to the left of the line; it indicates that a breakpoint is set. To remove a breakpoint, you can choose the menu command or the F9 key again.  \n  \n     If you're using a mouse, you can also set or remove a breakpoint by clicking in the left margin.  \n  \n4.  On the menu bar, choose **Debug**, **Start Debugging**, or choose the F5 key.  \n  \n     When the program reaches the line that has the breakpoint, execution stops temporarily, because your program is in Break mode. A yellow arrow to the left of a line of code indicates that it is the next line to be executed.  \n  \n5.  To examine the value of the `Cardgame::totalParticipants` variable, move the pointer over `Cardgame` and then move it over the expansion control at the left of the tooltip window. The variable name `totalParticipants` and its value of 12 are displayed.  \n  \n     Open the shortcut menu for the `Cardgame::totalParticipants` variable and then choose **Add Watch** to display that variable in the **Watch 1** window. You can also select a variable and drag it to the **Watch 1** window.  \n  \n6.  To step to the next line of code, on the menu bar, choose **Debug**, **Step Over**, or choose the F10 key.  \n  \n     The value of `Cardgame::totalParticipants` in the **Watch 1** window is now displayed as 13.  \n  \n7.  Open the shortcut menu for the `return 0;` statement and then choose **Run to Cursor**. The yellow arrow to the left of the code points to the next statement to be executed.  \n  \n8.  The `Cardgame::totalParticipants` number should decrease when a Cardgame terminates. At this point, `Cardgame::totalParticipants` should equal 0 because all Cardgame instances have been deleted, but the **Watch 1** window indicates that `Cardgame::totalparticipants` equals 18. This indicates that there's a bug in the code, which you can detect and fix by completing the next walkthrough, [Walkthrough: Debugging a Project (C++)](../ide/walkthrough-debugging-a-project-cpp.md).  \n  \n9. To stop the program, on the menu bar, choose **Debug**, **Stop Debugging**, or choose the Shift+F5 keyboard shortcut.  \n  \n## Next Steps  \n **Previous:** [Walkthrough: Building a Project (C++)](../ide/walkthrough-building-a-project-cpp.md) &#124; **Next:**[Walkthrough: Debugging a Project (C++)](../ide/walkthrough-debugging-a-project-cpp.md)  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Visual C++ Guided Tour](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/499cb66f-7df1-45d6-8b6b-33d94fd1f17c)   \n [DELETE_PENDING_Building and Debugging](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/9f6ba537-5ea0-46fb-b6ba-b63d657d84f1)"}
