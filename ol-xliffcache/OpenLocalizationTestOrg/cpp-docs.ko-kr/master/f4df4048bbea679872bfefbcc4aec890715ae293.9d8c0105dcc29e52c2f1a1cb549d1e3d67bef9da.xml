MFC instead uses [message maps](../mfc/message-categories.md) to map direct messages to distinct class member functions. Message maps are more efficient than virtual functions for this purpose, and they allow messages to be handled by the most appropriate C++ object — application, document, view, and so on. You can map a single message or a range of messages, command IDs, or control IDs.  \n  \n **WM_COMMAND** messages — usually generated by menus, toolbar buttons, or accelerators — also use the message-map mechanism. MFC defines a standard [routing](../mfc/command-routing.md) of command messages among the application, frame window, view, and Active documents in your program. You can override this routing if you need to.  \n  \n Message maps also supply a way to update user-interface objects (such as menus and toolbar buttons), enabling or disabling them to suit the current context.  \n  \n For general information about messages and message queues in Windows, see [Messages and Message Queues](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms632590) in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../atl/includes/winsdk_md.md)].  \n  \n## What do you want to know more about  \n  \n-   [Messages and Commands in the Framework](../mfc/messages-and-commands-in-the-framework.md)  \n  \n-   [How the framework calls a message handler](../mfc/how-the-framework-calls-a-handler.md)  \n  \n-   [How the Framework Searches Message Maps](../mfc/how-the-framework-searches-message-maps.md)  \n  \n-   [Declaring Message Handler Functions](../mfc/declaring-message-handler-functions.md)  \n  \n-   [Mapping Messages to Functions](../mfc/reference/mapping-messages-to-functions.md)  \n  \n-   [How to Display Command Information in the Status Bar](../mfc/how-to-display-command-information-in-the-status-bar.md)  \n  \n-   [Dynamic update of user-interface objects](../mfc/how-to-update-user-interface-objects.md)  \n  \n-   [How to: Create a Message Map for a Template Class](../mfc/how-to-create-a-message-map-for-a-template-class.md)  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Concepts](../mfc/mfc-concepts.md)   \n [General MFC Topics](../mfc/general-mfc-topics.md)   \n [CWnd Class](../mfc/reference/cwnd-class.md)   \n [CCmdTarget Class](../mfc/reference/ccmdtarget-class.md)\n"}
