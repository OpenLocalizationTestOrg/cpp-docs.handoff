When this option is set on an executable and all of the modules that it depends on, an operating system that supports 64-bit ASLR can rebase the segments of the executable image at load time by using randomized addresses in a 64-bit virtual address space. This large address space makes it more difficult for an attacker to guess the location of a particular memory region.  \n  \n By default, the linker sets this option for 64-bit executable images. To set this option, the [/DYNAMICBASE](../../build/reference/dynamicbase.md) option must also be set.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [EDITBIN Options](../../build/reference/editbin-options.md)   \n [/DYNAMICBASE](../../build/reference/dynamicbase.md)   \n [Windows ISV Software Security Defenses](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/bb430720.aspx)"}
