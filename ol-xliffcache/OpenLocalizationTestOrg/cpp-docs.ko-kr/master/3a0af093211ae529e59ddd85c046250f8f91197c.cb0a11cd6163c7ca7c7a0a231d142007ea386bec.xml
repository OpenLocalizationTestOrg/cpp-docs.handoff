SQL\\*Net is the Oracle network transport layer. Most Oracle ODBC drivers, including the Microsoft driver and the Microsoft OLE DB Oracle provider map, call directly to this SQL\\*Net layer.  \n  \n After SQL*Net is configured, notice your SQL\\*Net connection string. Typically, this consists of a specifier for the Oracle database server name and the network protocol type (such as TCP/IP and named pipes). Often, the SQL\\*Net connection string is mapped to an alias. In this case, it is only necessary to note the alias. For information about how to configure SQL\\*Net, contact your Oracle DBA, refer to the SQL\\*Net documentation, or refer to your Oracle ODBC driver Help file for an example of a connection string.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Creating Database Connections](../../data/ado-rdo/creating-database-connections.md)"}
