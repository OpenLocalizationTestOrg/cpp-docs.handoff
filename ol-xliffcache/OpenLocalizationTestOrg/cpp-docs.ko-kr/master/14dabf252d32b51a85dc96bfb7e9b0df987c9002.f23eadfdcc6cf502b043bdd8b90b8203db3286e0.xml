A `CWnd` object is created or destroyed by the `CWnd` constructor and destructor. The Windows window, on the other hand, is a data structure internal to Windows that is created by a **Create** member function and destroyed by the `CWnd` virtual destructor. The [DestroyWindow](#cwnd__destroywindow) function destroys the Windows window without destroying the object.  \n  \n The `CWnd` class and the message-map mechanism hide the **WndProc** function. Incoming Windows notification messages are automatically routed through the message map to the proper **On***Message*`CWnd` member functions. You override an **On***Message* member function to handle a member's particular message in your derived classes.  \n  \n The `CWnd` class also lets you create a Windows child window for your application. Derive a class from `CWnd`, then add member variables to the derived class to store data specific to your application. Implement message-handler member functions and a message map in the derived class to specify what happens when messages are directed to the window.  \n  \n You create a child window in two steps. First, call the constructor `CWnd` to construct the `CWnd` object, then call the [Create](#cwnd__create) member function to create the child window and attach it to the `CWnd` object.  \n  \n When the user terminates your child window, destroy the `CWnd` object, or call the `DestroyWindow` member function to remove the window and destroy its data structures.  \n  \n Within the Microsoft Foundation Class Library, further classes are derived from `CWnd` to provide specific window types. Many of these classes, including [CFrameWnd](../../mfc/reference/cframewnd-class.md), [CMDIFrameWnd](../../mfc/reference/cmdiframewnd-class.md), [CMDIChildWnd](../../mfc/reference/cmdichildwnd-class.md), [CView](../../mfc/reference/cview-class.md), and [CDialog](../../mfc/reference/cdialog-class.md), are designed for further derivation. The control classes derived from `CWnd`, such as [CButton](../../mfc/reference/cbutton-class.md), can be used directly or can be used for further derivation of classes.  \n  \n For more information on using `CWnd`, see [Frame Windows](../../mfc/frame-windows.md) and [Window Objects](../../mfc/window-objects.md).  \n  \n## Inheritance Hierarchy  \n [CObject](../../mfc/reference/cobject-class.md)  \n  \n [CCmdTarget](../../mfc/reference/ccmdtarget-class.md)  \n  \n `CWnd`  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Header:** afxwin.h  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__accdodefaultaction\"></a>  CWnd::accDoDefaultAction  \n Called by the framework to perform the object's default action.  \n  \n```  \nvirtual HRESULT accDoDefaultAction(VARIANT varChild);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `varChild`  \n Specifies whether the default action to be invoked is that of the object or one of the object's child elements.

The pointer may be temporary and should not be stored beyond the scope of [EndPaint](#cwnd__endpaint).  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The paint structure contains a RECT data structure that has the smallest rectangle that completely encloses the update region and a flag that specifies whether the background has been erased.  \n  \n The update region is set by the [Invalidate](#cwnd__invalidate), [InvalidateRect](#cwnd__invalidaterect), or [InvalidateRgn](#cwnd__invalidatergn) member functions and by the system after it sizes, moves, creates, scrolls, or performs any other operation that affects the client area. If the update region is marked for erasing, `BeginPaint` sends an [WM_ONERASEBKGND](#cwnd__onerasebkgnd) message.  \n  \n Do not call the `BeginPaint` member function except in response to a [WM_PAINT](#cwnd__onpaint) message. Each call to the `BeginPaint` member function must have a matching call to the [EndPaint](#cwnd__endpaint) member function. If the caret is in the area to be painted, the `BeginPaint` member function automatically hides the caret to prevent it from being erased.  \n  \n### Example  \n [!code-cpp[NVC_MFCWindowing#70](../../mfc/reference/codesnippet/cpp/cwnd-class_5.cpp)]  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__binddefaultproperty\"></a>  CWnd::BindDefaultProperty  \n Binds the calling object's default simple bound property (such as an edit control), as marked in the type library, to the underlying cursor that is defined by the DataSource, UserName, Password, and SQL properties of the data-source control.  \n  \n```  \nvoid BindDefaultProperty(\n    DISPID dwDispID,  \n    VARTYPE vtProp,  \n    LPCTSTR szFieldName,  \n    CWnd* pDSCWnd);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `dwDispID`  \n Specifies the DISPID of a property on a data-bound control that is to be bound to a data-source control.  \n  \n `vtProp`  \n Specifies the type of the property to be bound — for example, `VT_BSTR`, **VT_VARIANT**, and so on.  \n  \n `szFieldName`  \n Specifies the name of the column, in the cursor provided by the data-source control, to which the property will be bound.  \n  \n `pDSCWnd`  \n Points to the window that hosts the data-source control to which the property will be bound.

By default, the function centers child windows relative to their parent window, and pop-up windows relative to their owner. If the pop-up window is not owned, it is centered relative to the screen. To center a window relative to a specific window which is not the owner or parent, the `pAlternateOwner` parameter may be set to a valid window. To force centering relative to the screen, pass the value returned by [CWnd::GetDesktopWindow](#cwnd__getdesktopwindow) as `pAlternateOwner`.  \n  \n### Example  \n [!code-cpp[NVC_MFCWindowing#74](../../mfc/reference/codesnippet/cpp/cwnd-class_13.cpp)]  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__changeclipboardchain\"></a>  CWnd::ChangeClipboardChain  \n Removes `CWnd` from the chain of Clipboard viewers and makes the window specified by `hWndNext` the descendant of the `CWnd` ancestor in the chain.  \n  \n```  \nBOOL ChangeClipboardChain(HWND hWndNext);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `hWndNext`  \n Identifies the window that follows `CWnd` in the Clipboard-viewer chain.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Nonzero if successful; otherwise 0.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__checkdlgbutton\"></a>  CWnd::CheckDlgButton  \n Selects (places a check mark next to) or clears (removes a check mark from) a button, or it changes the state of a three-state button.  \n  \n```  \nvoid CheckDlgButton(\n    int nIDButton,  \n    UINT nCheck);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `nIDButton`  \n Specifies the button to be modified.  \n  \n `nCheck`  \n Specifies the action to take.

It is **NULL** if the given point lies outside of the client area. If the point is within the client area but is not contained within any child window, `CWnd` is returned.  \n  \n This member function will return a hidden or disabled child window that contains the specified point.  \n  \n More than one window may contain the given point. However, this function returns only the `CWnd`* of the first window encountered that contains the point.  \n  \n The `CWnd`* that is returned may be temporary and should not be stored for later use.  \n  \n### Example  \n [!code-cpp[NVC_MFCWindowing#77](../../mfc/reference/codesnippet/cpp/cwnd-class_16.cpp)]  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__clienttoscreen\"></a>  CWnd::ClientToScreen  \n Converts the client coordinates of a given point or rectangle on the display to screen coordinates.  \n  \n```  \nvoid ClientToScreen(LPPOINT lpPoint) const;\n\n \n \nvoid ClientToScreen(LPRECT lpRect) const;\n\n \n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `lpPoint`  \n Points to a [POINT structure](../../mfc/reference/point-structure1.md) or `CPoint` object that contains the client coordinates to be converted.  \n  \n `lpRect`  \n Points to a [RECT structure](../../mfc/reference/rect-structure1.md) or `CRect` object that contains the client coordinates to be converted.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The `ClientToScreen` member function uses the client coordinates in the **POINT** or `RECT` structure or the `CPoint` or `CRect` object pointed to by `lpPoint` or `lpRect` to compute new screen coordinates; it then replaces the coordinates in the structure with the new coordinates. The new screen coordinates are relative to the upper-left corner of the system display.  \n  \n The `ClientToScreen` member function assumes that the given point or rectangle is in client coordinates.  \n  \n### Example  \n [!code-cpp[NVC_MFCWindowing#78](../../mfc/reference/codesnippet/cpp/cwnd-class_17.cpp)]  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__closewindow\"></a>  CWnd::CloseWindow  \n Minimizes the window.  \n  \n```  \nvoid CloseWindow();\n```  \n  \n### Remarks  \n This member function emulates the functionality of the function [CloseWindow](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms632678), as described in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../../atl/includes/winsdk_md.md)].  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__continuemodal\"></a>  CWnd::ContinueModal  \n This member function is called by [RunModalLoop](#cwnd__runmodalloop) to determine when the modal state should be exited.  \n  \n```  \nvirtual BOOL ContinueModal();\n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Nonzero if modal loop is to be continued; 0 when [EndModalLoop](#cwnd__endmodalloop) is called.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n By default, it returns non-zero until `EndModalLoop` is called.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__create\"></a>  CWnd::Create  \n Creates the specified child window and attaches it to the [CWnd](../../mfc/reference/cwnd-class.md) object.  \n  \n```  \nvirtual BOOL Create(\n    LPCTSTR lpszClassName,  \n    LPCTSTR lpszWindowName,  \n    DWORD dwStyle,  \n    Const RECT& rect,  \n    CWnd* pParentWnd,  \n    UINT nID,  \n    CCreateContext* pContext = NULL);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n [in] `lpszClassName`  \n Pointer to a null-terminated string that contains the name of a registered system window class; or the name of a predefined system window class.  \n  \n [in] `lpszWindowName`  \n Pointer to a null-terminated string that contains the window display name; otherwise `NULL` for no window display name.  \n  \n [in] `dwStyle`  \n Bitwise combination (OR) of [window styles](../../mfc/reference/window-styles.md).

A `TRACE` statement in `CWnd::Create` alerts the developer of the problem.  \n  \n Use the [AfxRegisterWndClass](../../mfc/reference/application-information-and-management.md#afxregisterwndclass) function to register window classes. User defined window classes are available in the module where they are registered.  \n  \n The [CWnd::OnCreate](#cwnd__oncreate) method is called before the `Create` method returns, and before the window becomes visible.  \n  \n### Example  \n [!code-cpp[NVC_MFCWindowing#79](../../mfc/reference/codesnippet/cpp/cwnd-class_18.cpp)]  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__createaccessibleproxy\"></a>  CWnd::CreateAccessibleProxy  \n Creates an Active Accessibility proxy for the specified object.  \n  \n```  \nvirtual HRESULT CreateAccessibleProxy(\n    WPARAM wParam,  \n    LPARAM lParam,  \n    LRESULT* pResult);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `wParam`  \n Identifies the object accessed by the Active Accessibility proxy.

Once created, the caret is initially hidden. To show the caret, the [ShowCaret](#cwnd__showcaret) member function must be called.  \n  \n The system caret is a shared resource. `CWnd` should create a caret only when it has the input focus or is active. It should destroy the caret before it loses the input focus or becomes inactive.  \n  \n### Example  \n [!code-cpp[NVC_MFCWindowing#80](../../mfc/reference/codesnippet/cpp/cwnd-class_19.cpp)]  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__createcontrol\"></a>  CWnd::CreateControl  \n Use this member function to create an ActiveX control that will be represented in the MFC program by a `CWnd` object.  \n  \n```  \nBOOL CreateControl(\n    LPCTSTR pszClass,  \n    LPCTSTR pszWindowName,  \n    DWORD dwStyle,  \n    const RECT& rect,  \n    CWnd* pParentWnd,  \n    UINT nID,  \n    CFile* pPersist = NULL,  \n    BOOL bStorage = FALSE,  \n    BSTR bstrLicKey = NULL);\n\n \nBOOL CreateControl(\n    REFCLSID clsid,  \n    LPCTSTR pszWindowName,  \n    DWORD dwStyle,  \n    const RECT& rect,  \n    CWnd* pParentWnd,  \n    UINT nID,  \n    CFile* pPersist = NULL,  \n    BOOL bStorage = FALSE,  \n    BSTR bstrLicKey = NULL);\n\n \nBOOL CreateControl(\n    REFCLSID clsid,  \n    LPCTSTR pszWindowName,  \n    DWORD dwStyle,  \n    const POINT* ppt,  \n    const SIZE* psize,  \n    CWnd* pParentWnd,  \n    UINT nID,  \n    CFile* pPersist = NULL,  \n    BOOL bStorage = FALSE,  \n    BSTR bstrLicKey = NULL);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n *pszClass*  \n This string may contain the OLE \"short name\" (ProgID) for the class, e.g., \"CIRC3.Circ3Ctrl.1\". The name needs to match the same name registered by the control. Alternatively, the string may contain the string form of a **CLSID**, contained in braces, e.g., \"{9DBAFCCF-592F-101B-85CE-00608CEC297B}\". In either case, `CreateControl` converts the string to the corresponding class ID.  \n  \n *pszWindowName*  \n A pointer to the text to be displayed in the control. Sets the value of the control's Caption or Text property (if any). If **NULL**, the control's Caption or Text property is not changed.  \n  \n `dwStyle`  \n Windows styles. The available styles are listed under Remarks.  \n  \n `rect`  \n Specifies the control's size and position. It can be either a [CRect](../../atl-mfc-shared/reference/crect-class.md) object or a [RECT structure](../../mfc/reference/rect-structure1.md).  \n  \n `ppt`  \n Points to a [POINT structure](../../mfc/reference/point-structure1.md) or `CPoint` object that contains the upper left corner of the control.  \n  \n `pSize`  \n Points to a [SIZE](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd145106) structure or `CSize` object that contains the control's size  \n  \n `pParentWnd`  \n Specifies the control's parent window. It must not be **NULL**.  \n  \n `nID`  \n Specifies the control's ID.  \n  \n `pPersist`  \n A pointer to a [CFile](../../mfc/reference/cfile-class.md) containing the persistent state for the control. The default value is **NULL**, indicating that the control initializes itself without restoring its state from any persistent storage. If not **NULL**, it should be a pointer to a `CFile`-derived object which contains the control's persistent data, in the form of either a stream or a storage. This data could have been saved in a previous activation of the client. The `CFile` can contain other data, but must have its read-write pointer set to the first byte of persistent data at the time of the call to `CreateControl`.  \n  \n `bStorage`  \n Indicates whether the data in `pPersist` should be interpreted as IStorage or IStream data. If the data in `pPersist` is a storage, `bStorage` should be **TRUE**. If the data in `pPersist` is a stream, `bStorage` should be **FALSE**. The default value is **FALSE**.  \n  \n *bstrLicKe*y  \n Optional license key data. This data is needed only for creating controls that require a run-time license key. If the control supports licensing, you must provide a license key for the creation of the control to succeed. The default value is **NULL**.  \n  \n `clsid`  \n The unique class ID of the control.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Nonzero if successful; otherwise 0.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n `CreateControl` is a direct analog of the [CWnd::Create](#cwnd__create) function, which creates the window for a `CWnd`. `CreateControl` creates an ActiveX control instead of an ordinary window.  \n  \n Only a subset of the Windows `dwStyle` flags are supported for `CreateControl`:  \n  \n- **WS_VISIBLE** Creates a window that is initially visible. Required if you want the control to be visible immediately, like ordinary windows.  \n  \n- **WS_DISABLED** Creates a window that is initially disabled. A disabled window cannot receive input from the user. Can be set if the control has an Enabled property.  \n  \n- `WS_BORDER` Creates a window with a thin-line border. Can be set if control has a BorderStyle property.  \n  \n- **WS_GROUP** Specifies the first control of a group of controls. The user can change the keyboard focus from one control in the group to the next by using the direction keys. All controls defined with the **WS_GROUP** style after the first control belong to the same group. The next control with the **WS_GROUP** style ends the group and starts the next group.  \n  \n- **WS_TABSTOP** Specifies a control that can receive the keyboard focus when the user presses the TAB key. Pressing the TAB key changes the keyboard focus to the next control of the **WS_TABSTOP** style.  \n  \n### Example  \n [!code-cpp[NVC_MFCWindowing#81](../../mfc/reference/codesnippet/cpp/cwnd-class_20.h)]  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__createex\"></a>  CWnd::CreateEx  \n Creates the specified window and attaches it to the `CWnd` object.  \n  \n```  \nvirtual BOOL CreateEx(\n    DWORD dwExStyle,  \n    LPCTSTR lpszClassName,  \n    LPCTSTR lpszWindowName,  \n    DWORD dwStyle,  \n    int x,  \n    int y,  \n    int nWidth,  \n    int nHeight,  \n    HWND hWndParent,  \n    HMENU nIDorHMenu,  \n    LPVOID lpParam = NULL);\n\n \nvirtual BOOL CreateEx(\n    DWORD dwExStyle,  \n    LPCTSTR lpszClassName,  \n    LPCTSTR lpszWindowName,  \n    DWORD dwStyle,  \n    const RECT& rect,  \n    CWnd* pParentWnd,  \n    UINT nID,  \n    LPVOID lpParam = NULL);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `dwExStyle`  \n Bitwise combination (OR) of [extended window styles](../../mfc/reference/extended-window-styles.md); otherwise `NULL` for the default extended window style.  \n  \n `lpszClassName`  \n Pointer to a null-terminated string that contains the name of a registered system window class; or the name of a predefined system window class.  \n  \n `lpszWindowName`  \n Pointer to a null-terminated string that contains the window display name; otherwise `NULL` for no window display name.  \n  \n `dwStyle`  \n Bitwise combination (OR) of [window styles](../../mfc/reference/window-styles.md); otherwise `NULL` for the default window style.  \n  \n `x`  \n The initial horizontal distance of the window from the left side of the screen or the parent window.  \n  \n `y`  \n The initial vertical distance of the window from the top of the screen or the parent window.  \n  \n `nWidth`  \n The width, in pixels, of the window.  \n  \n `nHeight`  \n The height, in pixels, of the window.  \n  \n `hwndParent`  \n For a child window, the handle to the parent window; otherwise, the handle of the owner window if the window has an owner.  \n  \n `nIDorHMenu`  \n For a child window, the window ID; otherwise, the ID of a menu for the window.  \n  \n `lpParam`  \n Pointer to user data that is passed to the [CWnd::OnCreate](#cwnd__oncreate) method in the `lpCreateParams` field.  \n  \n `rect`  \n The size and location of the window relative to the screen or the parent window.  \n  \n `pParentWnd`  \n For a child window, pointer to the parent window; otherwise, pointer to the owner window if the window has an owner.  \n  \n `nID`  \n For a child window, the window ID; otherwise, the ID of a menu for the window.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n `TRUE` if the method was successful; otherwise `FALSE`.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n  \n> [!WARNING]\n> `CWnd::PreCreateWindow` now assigns the hMenu member of its `CREATESTRUCT` parameter to the `this` pointer if the menu is `NULL` and the style contains `WS_CHILD`.

Dimensions for top-level windows are relative to the top-left corner of the screen.  \n  \n The [CWnd::OnCreate](#cwnd__oncreate) method is called before the `CreateEx` method returns, and before the window becomes visible.  \n  \n### Example  \n [!code-cpp[NVC_MFCWindowing#82](../../mfc/reference/codesnippet/cpp/cwnd-class_21.cpp)]  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__creategraycaret\"></a>  CWnd::CreateGrayCaret  \n Creates a gray rectangle for the system caret and claims ownership of the caret.  \n  \n```  \nvoid CreateGrayCaret(\n    int nWidth,  \n    int nHeight);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `nWidth`  \n Specifies the width of the caret (in logical units). If this parameter is 0, the width is set to the system-defined window-border width.  \n  \n `nHeight`  \n Specifies the height of the caret (in logical units). If this parameter is 0, the height is set to the system-defined window-border height.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The caret shape can be a line or a block.  \n  \n The parameters `nWidth` and `nHeight` specify the caret's width and height (in logical units); the exact width and height (in pixels) depend on the mapping mode.  \n  \n The system's window-border width or height can be retrieved by the [GetSystemMetrics](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms724385) Windows function with the **SM_CXBORDER** and **SM_CYBORDER** indexes. Using the window-border width or height ensures that the caret will be visible on a high-resolution display.  \n  \n The `CreateGrayCaret` member function automatically destroys the previous caret shape, if any, regardless of which window owns the caret. Once created, the caret is initially hidden. To show the caret, the [ShowCaret](#cwnd__showcaret) member function must be called.  \n  \n The system caret is a shared resource. `CWnd` should create a caret only when it has the input focus or is active. It should destroy the caret before it loses the input focus or becomes inactive.  \n  \n### Example  \n [!code-cpp[NVC_MFCWindowing#83](../../mfc/reference/codesnippet/cpp/cwnd-class_22.cpp)]  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__createsolidcaret\"></a>  CWnd::CreateSolidCaret  \n Creates a solid rectangle for the system caret and claims ownership of the caret.  \n  \n```  \nvoid CreateSolidCaret(\n    int nWidth,  \n    int nHeight);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `nWidth`  \n Specifies the width of the caret (in logical units). If this parameter is 0, the width is set to the system-defined window-border width.  \n  \n `nHeight`  \n Specifies the height of the caret (in logical units). If this parameter is 0, the height is set to the system-defined window-border height.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The caret shape can be a line or block.  \n  \n The parameters `nWidth` and `nHeight` specify the caret's width and height (in logical units); the exact width and height (in pixels) depend on the mapping mode.  \n  \n The system's window-border width or height can be retrieved by the [GetSystemMetrics](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms724385) Windows function with the **SM_CXBORDER** and **SM_CYBORDER** indexes. Using the window-border width or height ensures that the caret will be visible on a high-resolution display.  \n  \n The `CreateSolidCaret` member function automatically destroys the previous caret shape, if any, regardless of which window owns the caret. Once created, the caret is initially hidden. To show the caret, the [ShowCaret](#cwnd__showcaret) member function must be called.  \n  \n The system caret is a shared resource. `CWnd` should create a caret only when it has the input focus or is active. It should destroy the caret before it loses the input focus or becomes inactive.  \n  \n### Example  \n [!code-cpp[NVC_MFCWindowing#84](../../mfc/reference/codesnippet/cpp/cwnd-class_23.cpp)]  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__cwnd\"></a>  CWnd::CWnd  \n Constructs a `CWnd` object.  \n  \n```  \nCWnd();\n```  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The Windows window is not created and attached until the [CreateEx](#cwnd__createex) or [Create](#cwnd__create) member function is called.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__default\"></a>  CWnd::Default  \n Calls the default window procedure.  \n  \n```  \nLRESULT Default();\n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Depends on the message sent.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The default window procedure provides default processing for any window message that an application does not process. This member function ensures that every message is processed.  \n  \n### Example  \n [!code-cpp[NVC_MFCWindowing#85](../../mfc/reference/codesnippet/cpp/cwnd-class_24.cpp)]  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__defwindowproc\"></a>  CWnd::DefWindowProc  \n Calls the default window procedure, which provides default processing for any window message that an application does not process.  \n  \n```  \nvirtual LRESULT DefWindowProc(\n    UINT message,  \n    WPARAM wParam,  \n    LPARAM lParam);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `message`  \n Specifies the Windows message to be processed.  \n  \n `wParam`  \n Specifies additional message-dependent information.  \n  \n `lParam`  \n Specifies additional message-dependent information.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Depends on the message sent.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n This member function ensures that every message is processed. It should be called with the same parameters as those received by the window procedure.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__deletetempmap\"></a>  CWnd::DeleteTempMap  \n Called automatically by the idle time handler of the `CWinApp` object.  \n  \n```  \nstatic void PASCAL DeleteTempMap();\n```  \n  \n### Remarks  \n Deletes any temporary `CWnd` objects created by the `FromHandle` member function.  \n  \n### Example  \n [!code-cpp[NVC_MFCWindowing#86](../../mfc/reference/codesnippet/cpp/cwnd-class_25.cpp)]  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__destroywindow\"></a>  CWnd::DestroyWindow  \n Destroys the Windows window attached to the `CWnd` object.  \n  \n```  \nvirtual BOOL DestroyWindow();\n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Nonzero if the window is destroyed; otherwise 0.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The `DestroyWindow` member function sends appropriate messages to the window to deactivate it and remove the input focus. It also destroys the window's menu, flushes the application queue, destroys outstanding timers, removes Clipboard ownership, and breaks the Clipboard-viewer chain if `CWnd` is at the top of the viewer chain. It sends [WM_DESTROY](#cwnd__ondestroy) and [WM_NCDESTROY](#cwnd__onncdestroy) messages to the window. It does not destroy the `CWnd` object.  \n  \n `DestroyWindow` is a place holder for performing cleanup. Because `DestroyWindow` is a virtual function, it is shown in any `CWnd`-derived class in Class View. But even if you override this function in your `CWnd`-derived class, `DestroyWindow` is not necessarily called. If `DestroyWindow` is not called in the MFC code, then you have to explicitly call it in your own code if you want it to be called.  \n  \n Assume, for example, you have overridden `DestroyWindow` in a `CView`-derived class. Since MFC source code does not call `DestroyWindow` in any of its `CFrameWnd`-derived classes, your overridden `DestroyWindow` will not be called unless you call it explicitly.  \n  \n If the window is the parent of any windows, these child windows are automatically destroyed when the parent window is destroyed. The `DestroyWindow` member function destroys child windows first and then the window itself.  \n  \n The `DestroyWindow` member function also destroys modeless dialog boxes created by [CDialog::Create](../../mfc/reference/cdialog-class.md#cdialog__create).  \n  \n If the `CWnd` being destroyed is a child window and does not have the [WS_EX_NOPARENTNOTIFY](../../mfc/reference/extended-window-styles.md) style set, then the [WM_PARENTNOTIFY ](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms632638.aspx)       message is sent to the parent.  \n  \n### Example  \n [!code-cpp[NVC_MFCWindowing#87](../../mfc/reference/codesnippet/cpp/cwnd-class_26.cpp)]  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__detach\"></a>  CWnd::Detach  \n Detaches a Windows handle from a `CWnd` object and returns the handle.  \n  \n```  \nHWND Detach();\n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n A `HWND` to the Windows object.  \n  \n### Example  \n  See the example for [CWnd::Attach](#cwnd__attach).  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__dlgdirlist\"></a>  CWnd::DlgDirList  \n Fills a list box with a file or directory listing.  \n  \n```  \nint DlgDirList(\n    LPTSTR lpPathSpec,  \n    int nIDListBox,  \n    int nIDStaticPath,  \n    UINT nFileType);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `lpPathSpec`  \n Points to a null-terminated string that contains the path or filename. `DlgDirList` modifies this string, which should be long enough to contain the modifications. For more information, see the following \"Remarks\" section.  \n  \n `nIDListBox`  \n Specifies the identifier of a list box. If `nIDListBox` is 0, `DlgDirList` assumes that no list box exists and does not attempt to fill one.  \n  \n `nIDStaticPath`  \n Specifies the identifier of the static-text control used to display the current drive and directory. If `nIDStaticPath` is 0, `DlgDirList` assumes that no such text control is present.  \n  \n `nFileType`  \n Specifies the attributes of the files to be displayed. It can be any combination of the following values:  \n  \n- **DDL_READWRITE** Read-write data files with no additional attributes.  \n  \n- **DDL_READONLY** Read-only files.  \n  \n- **DDL_HIDDEN** Hidden files.  \n  \n- **DDL_SYSTEM** System files.  \n  \n- **DDL_DIRECTORY** Directories.  \n  \n- **DDL_ARCHIVE** Archives.  \n  \n- **DDL_POSTMSGS LB_DIR** flag. If the **LB_DIR** flag is set, Windows places the messages generated by `DlgDirList` in the application's queue; otherwise, they are sent directly to the dialog-box procedure.  \n  \n- **DDL_DRIVES** Drives. If the **DDL_DRIVES** flag is set, the **DDL_EXCLUSIVE** flag is set automatically. Therefore, to create a directory listing that includes drives and files, you must call `DlgDirList` twice: once with the **DDL_DRIVES** flag set and once with the flags for the rest of the list.  \n  \n- **DDL_EXCLUSIVE** Exclusive bit. If the exclusive bit is set, only files of the specified type are listed; otherwise normal files and files of the specified type are listed.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Nonzero if the function is successful; otherwise 0.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n `DlgDirList` sends [LB_RESETCONTENT](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb761325) and [LB_DIR](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb775185) messages to the list box. It fills the list box specified by `nIDListBox` with the names of all files that match the path given by `lpPathSpec`.  \n  \n The `lpPathSpec` parameter has the following form:  \n  \n `[drive:] [ [\\u]directory[\\idirectory]...\\u] [filename]`  \n  \n In this example, `drive` is a drive letter, `directory` is a valid directory name, and *filename* is a valid filename that must contain at least one wildcard. The wildcards are a question mark ( ****), which means match any character, and an asterisk ( **\\***), meaning match any number of characters.  \n  \n If you specify a 0-length string for `lpPathSpec`, or if you specify only a directory name but do not include any file specification, the string will be changed to \"*.\\*\".  \n  \n If `lpPathSpec` includes a drive and/or directory name, the current drive and directory are changed to the designated drive and directory before the list box is filled. The text control identified by `nIDStaticPath` is also updated with the new drive and/or directory name.  \n  \n After the list box is filled, `lpPathSpec` is updated by removing the drive and/or directory portion of the path.  \n  \n### Example  \n [!code-cpp[NVC_MFCWindowing#88](../../mfc/reference/codesnippet/cpp/cwnd-class_27.cpp)]  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__dlgdirlistcombobox\"></a>  CWnd::DlgDirListComboBox  \n Fills the list box of a combo box with a file or directory listing.  \n  \n```  \nint DlgDirListComboBox(\n    LPTSTR lpPathSpec,  \n    int nIDComboBox,  \n    int nIDStaticPath,  \n    UINT nFileType);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `lpPathSpec`  \n Points to a null-terminated string that contains the path or filename. `DlgDirListComboBox` modifies this string, so this data should not be in the form of a string literal. See the following \"Remarks\" section.  \n  \n `nIDComboBox`  \n Specifies the identifier of a combo box in a dialog box. If `nIDComboBox` is 0, `DlgDirListComboBox` assumes that no combo box exists and does not attempt to fill one.  \n  \n `nIDStaticPath`  \n Specifies the identifier of the static-text control used to display the current drive and directory. If `nIDStaticPath` is 0, `DlgDirListComboBox` assumes that no such text control is present.  \n  \n `nFileType`  \n Specifies DOS file attributes of the files to be displayed. It can be any combination of the following values:  \n  \n- **DDL_READWRITE** Read-write data files with no additional attributes.  \n  \n- **DDL_READONLY** Read-only files.  \n  \n- **DDL_HIDDEN** Hidden files.  \n  \n- **DDL_SYSTEM** System files.  \n  \n- **DDL_DIRECTORY** Directories.  \n  \n- **DDL_ARCHIVE** Archives.  \n  \n- **DDL_POSTMSGS CB_DIR** flag. If the **CB_DIR** flag is set, Windows places the messages generated by `DlgDirListComboBox` in the application's queue; otherwise, they are sent directly to the dialog-box procedure.  \n  \n- **DDL_DRIVES** Drives. If the **DDL_DRIVES** flag is set, the **DDL_EXCLUSIVE** flag is set automatically. Therefore, to create a directory listing that includes drives and files, you must call `DlgDirListComboBox` twice: once with the **DDL_DRIVES** flag set and once with the flags for the rest of the list.  \n  \n- **DDL_EXCLUSIVE** Exclusive bit. If the exclusive bit is set, only files of the specified type are listed; otherwise normal files and files of the specified type are listed.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Specifies the outcome of the function. It is nonzero if a listing was made, even an empty listing. A 0 return value implies that the input string did not contain a valid search path.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n `DlgDirListComboBox` sends [CB_RESETCONTENT](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb775878) and [CB_DIR](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb775832) messages to the combo box. It fills the list box of the combo box specified by `nIDComboBox` with the names of all files that match the path given by `lpPathSpec`.  \n  \n The `lpPathSpec` parameter has the following form:  \n  \n `[drive:] [ [\\u]directory[\\idirectory]...\\u] [filename]`  \n  \n In this example, `drive` is a drive letter, `directory` is a valid directory name, and *filename* is a valid filename that must contain at least one wildcard. The wildcards are a question mark ( ****), which means match any character, and an asterisk ( **\\***), which means match any number of characters.  \n  \n If you specify a zero-length string for `lpPathSpec`, the current directory will be used and `lpPathSpec` will not be modified. If you specify only a directory name but do not include any file specification, the string will be changed to \"*\".  \n  \n If `lpPathSpec` includes a drive and/or directory name, the current drive and directory are changed to the designated drive and directory before the list box is filled. The text control identified by `nIDStaticPath` is also updated with the new drive and/or directory name.  \n  \n After the combo-box list box is filled, `lpPathSpec` is updated by removing the drive and/or directory portion of the path.  \n  \n### Example  \n [!code-cpp[NVC_MFCWindowing#89](../../mfc/reference/codesnippet/cpp/cwnd-class_28.cpp)]  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__dlgdirselect\"></a>  CWnd::DlgDirSelect  \n Retrieves the current selection from a list box.  \n  \n```  \nBOOL DlgDirSelect(\n    LPTSTR lpString,  \n    int nIDListBox);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `lpString`  \n Points to a buffer that is to receive the current selection in the list box.  \n  \n `nIDListBox`  \n Specifies the integer ID of a list box in the dialog box.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Nonzero if successful; otherwise 0.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n It assumes that the list box has been filled by the [DlgDirList](#cwnd__dlgdirlist) member function and that the selection is a drive letter, a file, or a directory name.  \n  \n The `DlgDirSelect` member function copies the selection to the buffer given by `lpString`. If there is no selection, `lpString` does not change.  \n  \n `DlgDirSelect` sends [LB_GETCURSEL](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb775197) and [LB_GETTEXT](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb761313) messages to the list box.  \n  \n It does not allow more than one filename to be returned from a list box. The list box must not be a multiple-selection list box.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__dlgdirselectcombobox\"></a>  CWnd::DlgDirSelectComboBox  \n Retrieves the current selection from the list box of a combo box.  \n  \n```  \nBOOL DlgDirSelectComboBox(\n    LPTSTR lpString,  \n    int nIDComboBox);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `lpString`  \n Points to a buffer that is to receive the selected path.  \n  \n `nIDComboBox`  \n Specifies the integer ID of the combo box in the dialog box.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Nonzero if successful; otherwise 0.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n It assumes that the list box has been filled by the [DlgDirListComboBox](#cwnd__dlgdirlistcombobox) member function and that the selection is a drive letter, a file, or a directory name.  \n  \n The `DlgDirSelectComboBox` member function copies the selection to the specified buffer. If there is no selection, the contents of the buffer are not changed.  \n  \n `DlgDirSelectComboBox` sends [CB_GETCURSEL](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb775845) and [CB_GETLBTEXT](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb775862) messages to the combo box.  \n  \n It does not allow more than one filename to be returned from a combo box.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__dodataexchange\"></a>  CWnd::DoDataExchange  \n Called by the framework to exchange and validate dialog data.  \n  \n```  \nvirtual void DoDataExchange(CDataExchange* pDX);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `pDX`  \n A pointer to a `CDataExchange` object.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n Never call this function directly. It is called by the [UpdateData](#cwnd__updatedata) member function. Call `UpdateData` to initialize a dialog box's controls or retrieve data from a dialog box.  \n  \n When you derive an application-specific dialog class from [CDialog](../../mfc/reference/cdialog-class.md), you need to override this member function if you wish to utilize the framework's automatic data exchange and validation. The Add Variable wizard will write an overridden version of this member function for you containing the desired \"data map\" of dialog data exchange (DDX) and validation (DDV) global function calls.  \n  \n To automatically generate an overridden version of this member function, first create a dialog resource with the dialog editor, then derive an application-specific dialog class. Then use the Add Variable wizard to associate variables, data, and validation ranges with various controls in the new dialog box. The wizard then writes the overridden `DoDataExchange`, which contains a data map. The following is an example DDX/DDV code block generated by the Add Variable wizard:  \n  \n [!code-cpp[NVC_MFCWindowing#90](../../mfc/reference/codesnippet/cpp/cwnd-class_29.cpp)]  \n  \n The `DoDataExchange` overridden member function must precede the macro statements in your source file.  \n  \n For more information on dialog data exchange and validation, see [Displaying and Manipulating Data in a Form](../../data/odbc/displaying-and-manipulating-data-in-a-form.md) and [Dialog Data Exchange and Validation](../../mfc/dialog-data-exchange-and-validation.md). For a description of the DDX_ and DDV_ macros generated by the Add Variable wizard, see [Technical Note 26](../../mfc/tn026-ddx-and-ddv-routines.md).  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__dragacceptfiles\"></a>  CWnd::DragAcceptFiles  \n Call this member function from within a window, using a `CWnd` pointer, in your application's [CWinApp::InitInstance](../../mfc/reference/cwinapp-class.md#cwinapp__initinstance) function to indicate that the window accepts dropped files from the Windows File Manager or File Explorer.  \n  \n```  \nvoid DragAcceptFiles(BOOL bAccept = TRUE);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n *BAccept*  \n Flag that indicates whether dragged files are accepted.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n Only the window that calls `DragAcceptFiles` with the `bAccept` parameter set to **TRUE** has identified itself as able to process the Windows message `WM_DROPFILES`. For example, in an MDI application, if the `CMDIFrameWnd` window pointer is used in the `DragAcceptFiles` function call, only the `CMDIFrameWnd` window gets the `WM_DROPFILES` message. This message is not sent to all open `CMDIChildWnd` windows. For a `CMDIChildWnd` window to receive this message, you must call `DragAcceptFiles` with the `CMDIChildWnd` window pointer.  \n  \n To discontinue receiving dragged files, call the member function with `bAccept` set to **FALSE**.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__dragdetect\"></a>  CWnd::DragDetect  \n Captures the mouse and tracks its movement until the user releases the left button, presses the ESC key, or moves the mouse outside the drag rectangle around the specified point.  \n  \n```  \nBOOL DragDetect(POINT pt) const;\n\n \n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `pt`  \n Initial position of the mouse, in screen coordinates. The function determines the coordinates of the drag rectangle by using this point.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n If the user moved the mouse outside of the drag rectangle while holding down the left button , the return value is nonzero.  \n  \n If the user did not move the mouse outside of the drag rectangle while holding down the left button , the return value is zero.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n This member function emulates the functionality of the function [DragDetect](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms646256), as described in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../../atl/includes/winsdk_md.md)].  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__drawanimatedrects\"></a>  CWnd::DrawAnimatedRects  \n Draws a wire-frame rectangle and animates it to indicate the opening of an icon or the minimizing or maximizing of a window.  \n  \n```  \nBOOL DrawAnimatedRects(\n    int idAni,  \n    CONST RECT* lprcFrom,  \n    CONST RECT* lprcTo);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n *idAni*  \n Specifies the type of animation. If you specify **IDANI_CAPTION**, the window caption will animate from the position specified by `lprcFrom` to the position specified by `lprcTo`. The effect is similar to minimizing or maximizing a window.  \n  \n `lprcFrom`  \n Pointer to a [RECT](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd162897) structure specifying the location and size of the icon or minimized window.  \n  \n `lprcTo`  \n Pointer to a [RECT](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd162897) structure specifying the location and size of the restored window  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Nonzero if the function succeeds; otherwise 0.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n This member function emulates the functionality of the function [DrawAnimatedRects](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd162475), as described in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../../atl/includes/winsdk_md.md)].  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__drawcaption\"></a>  CWnd::DrawCaption  \n Draws a window caption.  \n  \n```  \nBOOL DrawCaption(\n    CDC* pDC,  \n    LPCRECT lprc,  \n    UINT uFlags);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `pDC`  \n A pointer to a device context. The function draws the window caption into this device context.  \n  \n `lprc`  \n A pointer to a RECT structure that specifies the bounding rectangle for the window caption.  \n  \n `uFlags`  \n Specifies drawing options. For a complete list of values, see [DrawCaption](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd162476).  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Nonzero if the function succeeds; otherwise 0.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n This member function emulates the functionality of the function [DrawCaption](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd162476), as described in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../../atl/includes/winsdk_md.md)].  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__drawmenubar\"></a>  CWnd::DrawMenuBar  \n Redraws the menu bar.  \n  \n```  \nvoid DrawMenuBar();\n```  \n  \n### Remarks  \n If a menu bar is changed after Windows has created the window, call this function to draw the changed menu bar.  \n  \n### Example  \n  See the example for [CWnd::GetMenu](#cwnd__getmenu).  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__enableactiveaccessibility\"></a>  CWnd::EnableActiveAccessibility  \n Enables user-defined Active Accessibility functions.  \n  \n```  \nvoid EnableActiveAccessibility();\n```  \n  \n### Remarks  \n MFC's default Active Accessibility support is sufficient for standard windows and controls, including ActiveX controls; however, if your `CWnd`-derived class contains nonwindowed user interface elements, MFC has no way of knowing about them. In that case, you must override the appropriate [Active Accessibility member functions](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/68af04ac-4eb9-4b7d-b33f-c45512097a74) in your class, and you must call **EnableActiveAccessibility** in the class's constructor.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__enabledynamiclayout\"></a>  CWnd::EnableDynamicLayout  \n Enables or disables the dynamic layout manager. When dynamic layout is enabled, the position and size of child windows can adjust dynamically when the user resizes the window.  \n  \n```  \nvoid EnableDynamicLayout(BOOL bEnable = TRUE);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `bEnable`  \n TRUE to enable dynamic layout; FALSE to disable dynamic layout.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n If you want to enable dynamic layout, you have to do more than just call this method. You also have to provide dynamic layout information which species how the controls in the window respond to size changes. You can specify this information in the resource editor, or programmatically, for each control. See [Dynamic Layout](../../mfc/dynamic-layout.md).  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__enabled2dsupport\"></a>  CWnd::EnableD2DSupport  \n Enables or disables window D2D support. Call this method before the main window is initialized.  \n  \n```  \nvoid EnableD2DSupport(\n    BOOL bEnable = TRUE,  \n    BOOL bUseDCRenderTarget = FALSE);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `bEnable`  \n Specifies whether to turn on, or off D2D support.  \n  \n `bUseDCRenderTarget`  \n Species whether to use the Device Context (DC) render target, CDCRenderTarget. If FALSE, CHwndRenderTarget is used.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__enablescrollbar\"></a>  CWnd::EnableScrollBar  \n Enables or disables one or both arrows of a scroll bar.  \n  \n```  \nBOOL EnableScrollBar(\n    int nSBFlags,  \n    UINT nArrowFlags = ESB_ENABLE_BOTH);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n *nSBFlags*  \n Specifies the scroll-bar type. Can have one of the following values:  \n  \n- **SB_BOTH** Enables or disables the arrows of the horizontal and vertical scroll bars associated with the window.  \n  \n- **SB_HORZ** Enables or disables the arrows of the horizontal scroll bar associated with the window.  \n  \n- **SB_VERT** Enables or disables the arrows of the vertical scroll bar associated with the window.  \n  \n `nArrowFlags`  \n Specifies whether the scroll-bar arrows are enabled or disabled and which arrows are enabled or disabled. Can have one of the following values:  \n  \n- **ESB_ENABLE_BOTH** Enables both arrows of a scroll bar (default).  \n  \n- **ESB_DISABLE_LTUP** Disables the left arrow of a horizontal scroll bar or the up arrow of a vertical scroll bar.  \n  \n- **ESB_DISABLE_RTDN** Disables the right arrow of a horizontal scroll bar or the down arrow of a vertical scroll bar.  \n  \n- **ESB_DISABLE_BOTH** Disables both arrows of a scroll bar.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Nonzero if the arrows are enabled or disabled as specified. Otherwise it is 0, which indicates that the arrows are already in the requested state or that an error occurred.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__enablescrollbarctrl\"></a>  CWnd::EnableScrollBarCtrl  \n Enables or disables the scroll bar for this window.  \n  \n```  \nvoid EnableScrollBarCtrl(\n    int nBar,  \n    BOOL bEnable = TRUE);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `nBar`  \n The scroll-bar identifier.  \n  \n `bEnable`  \n Specifies whether the scroll bar is to be enabled or disabled.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n If the window has a sibling scroll-bar control, that scroll bar is used; otherwise the window's own scroll bar is used.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__enabletooltips\"></a>  CWnd::EnableToolTips  \n Enables tool tips for the given window.  \n  \n```  \nBOOL EnableToolTips(BOOL bEnable = TRUE);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `bEnable`  \n Specifies whether the tool tip control is enabled or disabled. **TRUE** enables the control; **FALSE** disables the control.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n **TRUE** if tool tips are enabled; otherwise **FALSE**.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n Override [OnToolHitTest](#cwnd__ontoolhittest) to provide the [TOOLINFO](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb760256) struct or structs for the window.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  Some windows, such as [CToolBar](../../mfc/reference/ctoolbar-class.md), provide a built-in implementation of [OnToolHitTest](#cwnd__ontoolhittest).  \n  \n See [TOOLINFO](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb760256) in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../../atl/includes/winsdk_md.md)] for more information on this structure.  \n  \n Simply calling `EnableToolTips` is not enough to display tool tips for your child controls unless the parent window is derived from `CFrameWnd`. This is because `CFrameWnd` provides a default handler for the **TTN_NEEDTEXT** notification. If your parent window is not derived from `CFrameWnd`, that is, if it is a dialog box or a form view, tool tips for your child controls will not display correctly unless you provide a handler for the **TTN_NEEDTEXT** tool tip notification. See [Tool Tips](../../mfc/tool-tips-in-windows-not-derived-from-cframewnd.md).  \n  \n The default tool tips provided for your windows by `EnableToolTips` do not have text associated with them. To retrieve text for the tool tip to display, the **TTN_NEEDTEXT** notification is sent to the tool tip control's parent window just before the tool tip window is displayed. If there is no handler for this message to assign some value to the `pszText` member of the **TOOLTIPTEXT** structure, there will be no text displayed for the tool tip.  \n  \n### Example  \n [!code-cpp[NVC_MFCWindowing#91](../../mfc/reference/codesnippet/cpp/cwnd-class_30.cpp)]  \n  \n [!code-cpp[NVC_MFCWindowing#92](../../mfc/reference/codesnippet/cpp/cwnd-class_31.cpp)]  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__enabletrackingtooltips\"></a>  CWnd::EnableTrackingToolTips  \n Enables or disables tracking tooltips.  \n  \n```  \nBOOL EnableTrackingToolTips(BOOL bEnable = TRUE);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `bEnable`  \n Specifies whether tracking tool tips are enabled or disabled. If this parameter is **TRUE**, the tracking tool tips will be enabled. If this parameter is **FALSE**, the tracking tool tips will be disabled.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Indicates the state before the `EnableWindow` member function was called. The return value is nonzero if the window was previously disabled. The return value is 0 if the window was previously enabled or an error occurred.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n Tracking tool tips are tool tip windows that you can dynamically position on the screen. By rapidly updating the position, the tool tip window appears to move smoothly, or \"track.\" This functionality can be useful if you need tool tip text to follow the position of the pointer as it moves.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__enablewindow\"></a>  CWnd::EnableWindow  \n Enables or disables mouse and keyboard input.  \n  \n```  \nBOOL EnableWindow(BOOL bEnable = TRUE);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `bEnable`  \n Specifies whether the given window is to be enabled or disabled. If this parameter is **TRUE**, the window will be enabled. If this parameter is **FALSE**, the window will be disabled.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Indicates the state before the `EnableWindow` member function was called. The return value is nonzero if the window was previously disabled. The return value is 0 if the window was previously enabled or an error occurred.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n When input is disabled, input such as mouse clicks and keystrokes is ignored. When input is enabled, the window processes all input.  \n  \n If the enabled state is changing, the [WM_ENABLE](#cwnd__onenable) message is sent before this function returns.  \n  \n If disabled, all child windows are implicitly disabled, although they are not sent `WM_ENABLE` messages.  \n  \n A window must be enabled before it can be activated. For example, if an application is displaying a modeless dialog box and has disabled its main window, the main window must be enabled before the dialog box is destroyed. Otherwise, another window will get the input focus and be activated. If a child window is disabled, it is ignored when Windows tries to determine which window should get mouse messages.  \n  \n By default, a window is enabled when it is created. An application can specify the **WS_DISABLED** style in the [Create](#cwnd__create) or [CreateEx](#cwnd__createex) member function to create a window that is initially disabled. After a window has been created, an application can also use the `EnableWindow` member function to enable or disable the window.  \n  \n An application can use this function to enable or disable a control in a dialog box. A disabled control cannot receive the input focus, nor can a user access it.  \n  \n### Example  \n [!code-cpp[NVC_MFCWindowing#93](../../mfc/reference/codesnippet/cpp/cwnd-class_32.cpp)]  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__endmodalloop\"></a>  CWnd::EndModalLoop  \n Terminates a call to `RunModalLoop`.  \n  \n```  \nvirtual void EndModalLoop(int nResult);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `nResult`  \n Contains the value to be returned to the caller of [RunModalLoop](#cwnd__runmodalloop).  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The `nResult` parameter is propagated to the return value from `RunModalLoop`.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__endmodalstate\"></a>  CWnd::EndModalState  \n Call this member function to change a frame window from modal to modeless.  \n  \n```  \nvirtual void EndModalState();\n```  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__endpaint\"></a>  CWnd::EndPaint  \n Marks the end of painting in the given window.  \n  \n```  \nvoid EndPaint(LPPAINTSTRUCT lpPaint);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `lpPaint`  \n Points to a [PAINTSTRUCT](../../mfc/reference/paintstruct-structure.md) structure that contains the painting information retrieved by the [BeginPaint](#cwnd__beginpaint) member function.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The `EndPaint` member function is required for each call to the `BeginPaint` member function, but only after painting is complete.  \n  \n If the caret was hidden by the `BeginPaint` member function, `EndPaint` restores the caret to the screen.  \n  \n### Example  \n  See the example for [CWnd::BeginPaint](#cwnd__beginpaint).  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__executedlginit\"></a>  CWnd::ExecuteDlgInit  \n Initiates a dialog resource.  \n  \n```  \nBOOL ExecuteDlgInit(LPCTSTR lpszResourceName);\n\n \nBOOL ExecuteDlgInit(LPVOID lpResource);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `lpszResourceName`  \n A pointer to a null-terminated string specifying the name of the resource.  \n  \n `lpResource`  \n A pointer to a resource.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n **TRUE** if a dialog resource is executed; otherwise **FALSE**.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n `ExecuteDlgInit` will use resources bound to the executing module, or resources from other sources. To accomplish this, `ExecuteDlgInit` finds a resource handle by calling `AfxFindResourceHandle`. If your MFC application does not use the shared DLL (MFCx0[U][D].DLL), **AfxFindResourceHandle** calls [AfxGetResourceHandle](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/d0eff6c4-f566-471a-96b7-a5a70a751a92), which returns the current resource handle for the executable. If your MFC application that uses MFCx0[U][D].DLL, `AfxFindResourceHandle` traverses the **CDynLinkLibrary** object list of shared and extension DLLs looking for the correct resource handle.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__filtertooltipmessage\"></a>  CWnd::FilterToolTipMessage  \n Called by the framework to display tool tip messages.  \n  \n```  \nvoid FilterToolTipMessage(MSG* pMsg);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `pMsg`  \n A pointer to the tool tip message.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n In most MFC applications this method is called by the framework from [PreTranslateMessage](#cwnd__pretranslatemessage) and [EnableToolTips](#cwnd__enabletooltips), and you do not need to call it yourself.  \n  \n However, in certain applications, for example some ActiveX controls, these methods might not be invoked by the framework, and you will need to call FilterToolTipMessage yourself. For more information, see [Methods of Creating Tool Tips](../../mfc/methods-of-creating-tool-tips.md).  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__findwindow\"></a>  CWnd::FindWindow  \n Returns the top-level `CWnd` whose window class is given by `lpszClassName` and whose window name, or title, is given by `lpszWindowName`.  \n  \n```  \nstatic CWnd* PASCAL FindWindow(\n    LPCTSTR lpszClassName,  \n    LPCTSTR lpszWindowName);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `lpszClassName`  \n Points to a null-terminated string that specifies the window's class name (a **WNDCLASS** structure). If `lpClassName` is **NULL**, all class names match.  \n  \n `lpszWindowName`  \n Points to a null-terminated string that specifies the window name (the window's title). If `lpWindowName` is **NULL**, all window names match.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Identifies the window that has the specified class name and window name. It is **NULL** if no such window is found.  \n  \n The `CWnd`* may be temporary and should not be stored for later use.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n This function does not search child windows.  \n  \n### Example  \n [!code-cpp[NVC_MFCWindowing#94](../../mfc/reference/codesnippet/cpp/cwnd-class_33.cpp)]  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__findwindowex\"></a>  CWnd::FindWindowEx  \n Retrieves the window object whose class name and window name match the specified strings.  \n  \n```  \nstatic CWnd* FindWindowEx(\n    HWND hwndParent,  \n    HWND hwndChildAfter,  \n    LPCTSTR lpszClass,  \n    LPCTSTR lpszWindow);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n *hwndParent*  \n Handle to the parent window whose child windows are to be searched.  \n  \n *hwndChildAfter*  \n Handle to a child window. The search begins with the next child window in the Z order. The child window must be a direct child window of *hwndParent*, not just a descendant window.  \n  \n `lpszClass`  \n Pointer to a null-terminated string that specifies the class name or a class atom created by a previous call to the [RegisterClass](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms633586) or [RegisterClassEx](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms633587).  \n  \n *lpszWindow*  \n Pointer to a null-terminated string that specifies the window name (the window's title). If this parameter is **NULL**, all window names match.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n If the function succeeds, the return value is a pointer to the window object having the specified class and window names. If the function fails, the return value is **NULL**.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n This member function emulates the functionality of the function [FindWindowEx](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms633500), as described in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../../atl/includes/winsdk_md.md)].  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__flashwindow\"></a>  CWnd::FlashWindow  \n Flashes the given window once.  \n  \n```  \nBOOL FlashWindow(BOOL bInvert);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `bInvert`  \n Specifies whether the `CWnd` is to be flashed or returned to its original state. The `CWnd` is flashed from one state to the other if `bInvert` is **TRUE**. If `bInvert` is **FALSE**, the window is returned to its original state (either active or inactive).  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Nonzero if the window was active before the call to the `FlashWindow` member function; otherwise 0.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n For successive flashing, create a system timer and repeatedly call `FlashWindow`. Flashing the `CWnd` means changing the appearance of its title bar as if the `CWnd` were changing from inactive to active status, or vice versa. (An inactive title bar changes to an active title bar; an active title bar changes to an inactive title bar.)  \n  \n Typically, a window is flashed to inform the user that it requires attention but that it does not currently have the input focus.  \n  \n The `bInvert` parameter should be **FALSE** only when the window is getting the input focus and will no longer be flashing; it should be **TRUE** on successive calls while waiting to get the input focus.  \n  \n This function always returns nonzero for minimized windows. If the window is minimized, `FlashWindow` will simply flash the window's icon; `bInvert` is ignored for minimized windows.  \n  \n### Example  \n [!code-cpp[NVC_MFCWindowing#95](../../mfc/reference/codesnippet/cpp/cwnd-class_34.cpp)]  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__flashwindowex\"></a>  CWnd::FlashWindowEx  \n Flashes the given window.  \n  \n```  \nBOOL FlashWindowEx(\n    DWORD dwFlags,  \n    UINT uCount,  \n    DWORD dwTimeout);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `dwFlags`  \n Specifies the flash status. For a complete list of values, see the [FLASHWINFO](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms679348) structure.  \n  \n `uCount`  \n Specifies the number of times to flash the window.  \n  \n `dwTimeout`  \n Specifies the rate, in milliseconds, at which the window will be flashed. If `dwTimeout` is zero, the function uses the default cursor blink rate.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n The return value specifies the window's state before the call to the `FlashWindowEx` function. If the window caption was drawn as active before the call, the return value is nonzero. Otherwise, the return value is zero.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n This method emulates the functionality of the function [FlashWindowEx](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms679347), as described in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../../atl/includes/winsdk_md.md)].  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__fromhandle\"></a>  CWnd::FromHandle  \n Returns a pointer to a `CWnd` object when given a handle to a window. If a `CWnd` object is not attached to the handle, a temporary `CWnd` object is created and attached.  \n  \n```  \nstatic CWnd* PASCAL FromHandle(HWND hWnd);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `hWnd`  \n An `HWND` of a Windows window.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Returns a pointer to a `CWnd` object when given a handle to a window. If a `CWnd` object is not attached to the handle, a temporary `CWnd` object is created and attached.  \n  \n The pointer may be temporary and should not be stored for later use.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__fromhandlepermanent\"></a>  CWnd::FromHandlePermanent  \n Returns a pointer to a `CWnd` object when given a handle to a window.  \n  \n```  \nstatic CWnd* PASCAL FromHandlePermanent(HWND hWnd);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `hWnd`  \n An `HWND` of a Windows window.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n A pointer to a `CWnd` object.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n If a `CWnd` object is not attached to the handle, **NULL** is returned.  \n  \n This function, unlike [FromHandle](#cwnd__fromhandle), does not create temporary objects.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__get_accchild\"></a>  CWnd::get_accChild  \n Called by the framework to retrieve the address of an `IDispatch` interface for the specified child.  \n  \n```  \nvirtual HRESULT get_accChild(\n    VARIANT varChild,  \n    IDispatch** ppdispChild);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `varChild`  \n Identifies the child whose `IDispatch` interface is to be retrieved.  \n  \n *ppdispChild*  \n Receives the address of the child object's `IDispatch` interface.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Returns S_OK on success, a COM error code on failure.

It is **NULL** if no window has the mouse capture.  \n  \n The return value may be temporary and should not be stored for later use.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n Only one window has the mouse capture at any given time. A window receives the mouse capture when the [SetCapture](#cwnd__setcapture) member function is called. This window receives mouse input whether or not the cursor is within its borders.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__getcaretpos\"></a>  CWnd::GetCaretPos  \n Retrieves the client coordinates of the caret's current position and returns them as a `CPoint`.  \n  \n```  \nstatic CPoint PASCAL GetCaretPos();\n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n [CPoint](../../atl-mfc-shared/reference/cpoint-class.md) object containing the coordinates of the caret's position.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The caret position is given in the client coordinates of the `CWnd` window.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__getcheckedradiobutton\"></a>  CWnd::GetCheckedRadioButton  \n Retrieves the ID of the currently checked radio button in the specified group.  \n  \n```  \nint GetCheckedRadioButton(\n    int nIDFirstButton,  \n    int nIDLastButton);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `nIDFirstButton`  \n Specifies the integer identifier of the first radio button in the group.  \n  \n `nIDLastButton`  \n Specifies the integer identifier of the last radio button in the group.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n ID of the checked radio button, or 0 if none is selected.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__getclientrect\"></a>  CWnd::GetClientRect  \n Copies the client coordinates of the `CWnd` client area into the structure pointed to by `lpRect`.  \n  \n```  \nvoid GetClientRect(LPRECT lpRect) const;\n\n \n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `lpRect`  \n Points to a [RECT structure](../../mfc/reference/rect-structure1.md) or a `CRect` object to receive the client coordinates. The **left** and **top** members will be 0. The **right** and **bottom** members will contain the width and height of the window.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The client coordinates specify the upper-left and lower-right corners of the client area. Since client coordinates are relative to the upper-left corners of the `CWnd` client area, the coordinates of the upper-left corner are (0,0).  \n  \n### Example  \n  See the example for [CWnd::IsIconic](#cwnd__isiconic).  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__getclipboardowner\"></a>  CWnd::GetClipboardOwner  \n Retrieves the current owner of the Clipboard.  \n  \n```  \nstatic CWnd* PASCAL GetClipboardOwner();\n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Identifies the window that owns the Clipboard if the function is successful. Otherwise, it is **NULL**.  \n  \n The returned pointer may be temporary and should not be stored for later use.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The Clipboard can still contain data even if it is not currently owned.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__getclipboardviewer\"></a>  CWnd::GetClipboardViewer  \n Retrieves the first window in the Clipboard-viewer chain.  \n  \n```  \nstatic CWnd* PASCAL GetClipboardViewer();\n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Identifies the window currently responsible for displaying the Clipboard if successful; otherwise **NULL** (for example, if there is no viewer).  \n  \n The returned pointer may be temporary and should not be stored for later use.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__getcontrolunknown\"></a>  CWnd::GetControlUnknown  \n Call this member function to retrieve a pointer to an unknown OLE control.  \n  \n```  \nLPUNKNOWN GetControlUnknown();\n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n A pointer to the [IUnknown](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms680509) interface of the OLE control represented by this `CWnd` object. If this object does not represent an OLE control, the return value is **NULL**.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n You should not release this **IUnknown** pointer. Typically, you would use to obtain a specific interface of the control.  \n  \n The interface pointer returned by **GetControlUnknown** is not reference-counted. Do not call [IUnknown::Release](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms682317) on the pointer unless you have previously called [IUnknown::AddRef](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms691379) on it.  \n  \n### Example  \n [!code-cpp[NVC_MFCWindowing#96](../../mfc/reference/codesnippet/cpp/cwnd-class_35.cpp)]  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__getcurrentmessage\"></a>  CWnd::GetCurrentMessage  \n Returns a pointer to the message this window is currently processing. Should only be called when in an **On***Message* message-handler member function.  \n  \n```  \nstatic const MSG* PASCAL GetCurrentMessage();\n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Returns a pointer to the [MSG](../../mfc/reference/msg-structure1.md) structure that contains the message the window is currently processing. Should only be called when in an **On***Message* handler.  \n  \n### Example  \n  See the example for [CMDIFrameWnd::MDICascade](../../mfc/reference/cmdiframewnd-class.md#cmdiframewnd__mdicascade).  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__getdc\"></a>  CWnd::GetDC  \n Retrieves a pointer to a common, class, or private device context for the client area depending on the class style specified for the `CWnd`.  \n  \n```  \nCDC* GetDC();\n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Identifies the device context for the `CWnd` client area if successful; otherwise, the return value is **NULL**. The pointer may be temporary and should not be stored for later use.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n For common device contexts, `GetDC` assigns default attributes to the context each time it is retrieved. For class and private contexts, `GetDC` leaves the previously assigned attributes unchanged. The device context can be used in subsequent graphics device interface (GDI) functions to draw in the client area.  \n  \n Unless the device context belongs to a window class, the [ReleaseDC](#cwnd__releasedc) member function must be called to release the context after painting.  \n  \n A device context belonging to the `CWnd` class is returned by the `GetDC` member function if **CS_CLASSDC**, **CS_OWNDC**, or **CS_PARENTDC** was specified as a style in the **WNDCLASS** structure when the class was registered.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__getdcex\"></a>  CWnd::GetDCEx  \n Retrieves the handle of a device context for the `CWnd` window.  \n  \n```  \nCDC* GetDCEx(\n    CRgn* prgnClip,  \n    DWORD flags);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `prgnClip`  \n Identifies a clipping region that may be combined with the visible region of the client window.  \n  \n `flags`  \n Can have one of the following preset values:  \n  \n- **DCX_CACHE** Returns a device context from the cache rather than the **OWNDC** or **CLASSDC** window. Overrides **CS_OWNDC** and **CS_CLASSDC**.  \n  \n- **DCX_CLIPCHILDREN** Excludes the visible regions of all child windows below the `CWnd` window.  \n  \n- **DCX_CLIPSIBLINGS** Excludes the visible regions of all sibling windows above the `CWnd` window.  \n  \n- **DCX_EXCLUDERGN** Excludes the clipping region identified by `prgnClip` from the visible region of the returned device context.  \n  \n- **DCX_INTERSECTRGN** Intersects the clipping region identified by `prgnClip` within the visible region of the returned device context.  \n  \n- **DCX_LOCKWINDOWUPDATE** Allows drawing even if there is a `LockWindowUpdate` call in effect that would otherwise exclude this window. This value is used for drawing during tracking.  \n  \n- **DCX_PARENTCLIP** Uses the visible region of the parent window and ignores the parent window's **WS_CLIPCHILDREN** and **WS_PARENTDC** style bits. This value sets the device context's origin to the upper-left corner of the `CWnd` window.  \n  \n- **DCX_WINDOW** Returns a device context that corresponds to the window rectangle rather than the client rectangle.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n The device context for the specified window if the function is successful; otherwise **NULL**.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The device context can be used in subsequent GDI functions to draw in the client area.  \n  \n This function, which is an extension to the [GetDC](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd144871) function, gives an application more control over how and whether a device context for a window is clipped.  \n  \n Unless the device context belongs to a window class, the [ReleaseDC](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd162920) function must be called to release the context after drawing. Since only five common device contexts are available at any given time, failure to release a device context can prevent other applications from gaining access to a device context.  \n  \n To obtain a cached device context, an application must specify [DCX_CACHE](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd144873). If **DCX_CACHE** is not specified and the window is neither **CS_OWNDC** nor [CS_CLASSDC](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms633576), this function returns **NULL**.  \n  \n A device context with special characteristics is returned by the [GetDCEx](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd144873) function if the **CS_CLASSDC**, [CS_OWNDC](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms633576), or [CS_PARENTDC](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms633576) style was specified in the [WNDCLASS](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms633576) structure when the class was registered.  \n  \n For more information about these characteristics, see the description of the **WNDCLASS** structure in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../../atl/includes/winsdk_md.md)].  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__getdcrendertarget\"></a>  CWnd::GetDCRenderTarget  \n Retrieves the device context (DC) render target for the `CWnd` window.  \n  \n```  \nCDCRenderTarget* GetDCRenderTarget();\n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n The device context render target for the specified window if the function is successful; otherwise **NULL**.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__getdescendantwindow\"></a>  CWnd::GetDescendantWindow  \n Call this member function to find the descendant window specified by the given ID.  \n  \n```  \nCWnd* GetDescendantWindow(\n    int nID,  \n    BOOL bOnlyPerm = FALSE) const;\n\n \n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `nID`  \n Specifies the identifier of the control or child window to be retrieved.  \n  \n `bOnlyPerm`  \n Specifies whether the window to be returned can be temporary. If **TRUE**, only a permanent window can be returned; if **FALSE,** the function can return a temporary window. For more information on temporary windows see [Technical Note 3](../../mfc/tn003-mapping-of-windows-handles-to-objects.md).  \n  \n### Return Value  \n A pointer to a `CWnd` object, or **NULL** if no child window is found.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n This member function searches the entire tree of child windows, not only the windows that are immediate children.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__getdesktopwindow\"></a>  CWnd::GetDesktopWindow  \n Returns the Windows desktop window.  \n  \n```  \nstatic CWnd* PASCAL GetDesktopWindow();\n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Identifies the Windows desktop window. This pointer may be temporary and should not be stored for later use.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The desktop window covers the entire screen and is the area on top of which all icons and other windows are painted.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__getdlgctrlid\"></a>  CWnd::GetDlgCtrlID  \n Returns the window or control ID value for any child window, not only that of a control in a dialog box.  \n  \n```  \nint GetDlgCtrlID() const;\n\n \n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n The numeric identifier of the `CWnd` child window if the function is successful; otherwise 0.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n Since top-level windows do not have an ID value, the return value of this function is invalid if the `CWnd` is a top-level window.  \n  \n### Example  \n  See the example for [CWnd::OnCtlColor](#cwnd__onctlcolor).  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__getdlgitem\"></a>  CWnd::GetDlgItem  \n Retrieves a pointer to the specified control or child window in a dialog box or other window.  \n  \n```  \nCWnd* GetDlgItem(\n    int nID) const;\n\n \n \nvoid GetDlgItem(\n    int nID,  \n    HWND* phWnd) const;\n\n \n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `nID`  \n Specifies the identifier of the control or child window to be retrieved.  \n  \n `phWnd`  \n A pointer to a child window.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n A pointer to the given control or child window. If no control with the integer ID given by the `nID` parameter exists, the value is **NULL**.  \n  \n The returned pointer may be temporary and should not be stored for later use.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The pointer returned is usually cast to the type of control identified by `nID`.  \n  \n### Example  \n [!code-cpp[NVC_MFCWindowing#97](../../mfc/reference/codesnippet/cpp/cwnd-class_36.cpp)]  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__getdlgitemint\"></a>  CWnd::GetDlgItemInt  \n Retrieves the text of the control identified by `nID`.  \n  \n```  \nUINT GetDlgItemInt(\n    int nID,  \n    BOOL* lpTrans = NULL,  \n    BOOL bSigned = TRUE) const;\n\n \n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `nID`  \n Specifies the integer identifier of the dialog-box control to be translated.  \n  \n `lpTrans`  \n Points to the Boolean variable that is to receive the translated flag.  \n  \n `bSigned`  \n Specifies whether the value to be retrieved is signed.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Specifies the translated value of the dialog-box item text. Since 0 is a valid return value, `lpTrans` must be used to detect errors. If a signed return value is desired, cast it as an `int` type.  \n  \n The function returns 0 if the translated number is greater than INT_MAX (for signed numbers) or UINT_MAX (for unsigned).  \n  \n When errors occur, such as encountering nonnumeric characters and exceeding the above maximum, `GetDlgItemInt` copies 0 to the location pointed to by `lpTrans`. If there are no errors, `lpTrans` receives a nonzero value. If `lpTrans` is **NULL**, `GetDlgItemInt` does not warn about errors.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n It translates the text of the specified control in the given dialog box into an integer value by stripping any extra spaces at the beginning of the text and converting decimal digits. It stops the translation when it reaches the end of the text or encounters any nonnumeric character.  \n  \n If `bSigned` is **TRUE**, `GetDlgItemInt` checks for a minus sign (–) at the beginning of the text and translates the text into a signed number. Otherwise, it creates an unsigned value.  \n  \n It sends a [WM_GETTEXT](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms632627) message to the control.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__getdlgitemtext\"></a>  CWnd::GetDlgItemText  \n Call this member function to retrieve the title or text associated with a control in a dialog box.  \n  \n```  \nint GetDlgItemText(\n    int nID,  \n    LPTSTR lpStr,  \n    int nMaxCount) const;\n\n \n \nint GetDlgItemText(\n    int nID,  \n    CString& rString) const;\n\n \n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `nID`  \n Specifies the integer identifier of the control whose title is to be retrieved.  \n  \n `lpStr`  \n Points to the buffer to receive the control's title or text.  \n  \n `nMaxCount`  \n Specifies the maximum length (in characters) of the string to be copied to `lpStr`. If the string is longer than `nMaxCount`, it is truncated.  \n  \n `rString`  \n A reference to a [CString](../../atl-mfc-shared/reference/cstringt-class.md).  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Specifies the actual number of characters copied to the buffer, not including the terminating null character. The value is 0 if no text is copied.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The `GetDlgItemText` member function copies the text to the location pointed to by `lpStr` and returns a count of the number of bytes it copies.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__getdsccursor\"></a>  CWnd::GetDSCCursor  \n Call this member function to retrieve a pointer to the underlying cursor that is defined by the DataSource, UserName, Password, and SQL properties of the data-source control.  \n  \n```  \nIUnknown* GetDSCCursor();\n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n A pointer to a cursor that is defined by a data-source control. MFC takes care of calling `AddRef` for the pointer.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n Use the returned pointer to set the ICursor property of a complex data-bound control, such as the data-bound grid control. A data-source control will not become active until the first bound control requests its cursor. This can happen either explicitly by a call to `GetDSCCursor` or implicitly by the MFC binding manager. In either case, you can force a data-source control to become active by calling `GetDSCCursor` and then calling **Release** on the returned pointer to **IUnknown**. Activation will cause the data-source control to attempt to connect to the underlying data source. The returned pointer might be used in the following context:  \n  \n### Example  \n [!code-cpp[NVC_MFC_AxDataBinding#1](../../mfc/reference/codesnippet/cpp/cwnd-class_6.cpp)]  \n[!code-cpp[NVC_MFC_AxDataBinding#5](../../mfc/reference/codesnippet/cpp/cwnd-class_37.cpp)]  \n[!code-cpp[NVC_MFC_AxDataBinding#3](../../mfc/reference/codesnippet/cpp/cwnd-class_8.cpp)]  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__getdynamiclayout\"></a>  CWnd::GetDynamicLayout  \n Retrieves a pointer to the dynamic layout manager object.  \n  \n```  \nCMFCDynamicLayout* GetDynamicLayout();\n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n A pointer to the dynamic layout manager object, or NULL if dynamic layout is not enabled.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The window object owns and manages the lifetime of the returned pointer, so it should only be used to access the object; do not delete the pointer or store the pointer permanently.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__getexstyle\"></a>  CWnd::GetExStyle  \n Returns the window's extended style.  \n  \n```  \nDWORD GetExStyle() const;\n\n \n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n The window's extended style. For more information about the extended window styles used in MFC, see [Extended Window Styles](../../mfc/reference/extended-window-styles.md).  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__getfocus\"></a>  CWnd::GetFocus  \n Retrieves a pointer to the `CWnd` that currently has the input focus.  \n  \n```  \nstatic CWnd* PASCAL GetFocus();\n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n A pointer to the window that has the current focus, or **NULL** if there is no focus window.  \n  \n The pointer may be temporary and should not be stored for later use.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__getfont\"></a>  CWnd::GetFont  \n Sends the `WM_GETFONT` message to the window to retrieve the current font.  \n  \n```  \nCFont* GetFont() const;\n\n \n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Pointer to a [CFont](../../mfc/reference/cfont-class.md) object that is attached to the current font for the window.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n This method has no effect unless the window processes the `WM_GETFONT` message. Many MFC classes that derive from `CWnd` process this message because they are attached to a predefined window class that includes a message handler for the `WM_GETFONT` message. To use this method, classes that you derive from `CWnd` must define a method handler for the `WM_GETFONT` message.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__getforegroundwindow\"></a>  CWnd::GetForegroundWindow  \n Returns a pointer to the foreground window (the window with which the user is currently working).  \n  \n```  \nstatic CWnd* PASCAL GetForegroundWindow();\n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n A pointer to the foreground window. This may be a temporary `CWnd` object.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The foreground window applies only to top-level windows (frame windows or dialog boxes).  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__geticon\"></a>  CWnd::GetIcon  \n Call this member function to get the handle to either a big (32x32) or the handle to a small (16x16) icon, as indicated by `bBigIcon`.  \n  \n```  \nHICON GetIcon(BOOL bBigIcon) const;\n\n \n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `bBigIcon`  \n Specifies a 32 pixel by 32 pixel icon if **TRUE**; specifies a 16 pixel by 16 pixel icon if **FALSE**.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n A handle to an icon. If unsuccessful, returns **NULL**.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__getlastactivepopup\"></a>  CWnd::GetLastActivePopup  \n Determines which pop-up window owned by `CWnd` was most recently active.  \n  \n```  \nCWnd* GetLastActivePopup() const;\n\n \n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Identifies the most recently active pop-up window. The return value will be the window itself if any of the following conditions are met:  \n  \n-   The window itself was most recently active.  \n  \n-   The window does not own any pop-up windows.  \n  \n-   The window is not a top-level window or is owned by another window.  \n  \n The pointer may be temporary and should not be stored for later use.  \n  \n### Example  \n  See the example for [CWnd::FindWindow](#cwnd__findwindow).  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__getlayeredwindowattributes\"></a>  CWnd::GetLayeredWindowAttributes  \n Retrieves the opacity and transparency color key of a layered window.  \n  \n```  \nBOOL GetLayeredWindowAttributes(\n    COLORREF* pcrKey,  \n    BYTE* pbAlpha,  \n    DWORD* pdwFlags) const;\n\n \n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n *pcrKey*  \n Pointer to a **COLORREF** value that receives the transparency color key to be used when composing the layered window. All pixels painted by the window in this color will be transparent. This can be **NULL** if the argument is not needed.  \n  \n `pbAlpha`  \n Pointer to a **BYTE** that receives the Alpha value used to describe the opacity of the layered window. When the variable referred to by `pbAlpha` is 0, the window is completely transparent. When the variable referred to by `pbAlpha` is 255, the window is opaque. This can be **NULL** if the argument is not needed.  \n  \n *pdwFlags*  \n Pointer to a `DWORD` that receives a layering flag. This can be **NULL** if the argument is not needed. For a complete list of possible values, see [GetLayeredWindowAttributes](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms633508).  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Nonzero if the function succeeds; otherwise 0.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n This member function emulates the functionality of the function [GetLayeredWindowAttributes](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms633508), as described in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../../atl/includes/winsdk_md.md)].  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__getmenu\"></a>  CWnd::GetMenu  \n Retrieves a pointer to the menu for this window.  \n  \n```  \nCMenu* GetMenu() const;\n\n \n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Identifies the menu. The value is **NULL** if `CWnd` has no menu. The return value is undefined if `CWnd` is a child window.  \n  \n The returned pointer may be temporary and should not be stored for later use.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n This function should not be used for child windows because they do not have a menu.  \n  \n### Example  \n [!code-cpp[NVC_MFCWindowing#98](../../mfc/reference/codesnippet/cpp/cwnd-class_38.cpp)]  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__getmenubarinfo\"></a>  CWnd::GetMenuBarInfo  \n Retrieves information about the specified menu bar.  \n  \n```  \nBOOL GetMenuBarInfo(\n    LONG idObject,  \n    LONG idItem,  \n    PMENUBARINFO pmbi) const;\n\n \n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `idObject`  \n Specifies the menu object. For a list of possible values, see [GetMenuBarInfo](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms647833).  \n  \n `idItem`  \n Specifies the item for which to retrieve information. If this parameter is zero, the function retrieves information about the menu itself. If this parameter is 1, the function retrieves information about the first item on the menu, and so on.  \n  \n *pmbi*  \n Pointer to a [MENUBARINFO](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms647564) structure that receives the information.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Nonzero if the function succeeds; otherwise 0.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n This member function emulates the functionality of the function [GetMenuBarInfo](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms647833), as described in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../../atl/includes/winsdk_md.md)].  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__getnextdlggroupitem\"></a>  CWnd::GetNextDlgGroupItem  \n Searches for the previous or next control within a group of controls in a dialog box.  \n  \n```  \nCWnd* GetNextDlgGroupItem(\n    CWnd* pWndCtl,  \n    BOOL bPrevious = FALSE) const;\n\n \n \nCOleControlSiteOrWnd* GetNextDlgGroupItem(\n    COleControlSiteOrWnd* pCurSiteOrWnd = NULL) const;\n\n \n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `pWndCtl`  \n Identifies the control to be used as the starting point for the search.  \n  \n `bPrevious`  \n Specifies how the function is to search the group of controls in the dialog box. If **TRUE**, the function searches for the previous control in the group; if **FALSE**, it searches for the next control in the group.  \n  \n `pCurSiteOrWnd`  \n Identifies the **COleControlSiteOrWnd** control. For more information about `COleControlSiteOrWnd`, see **Remarks**.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Pointer to the previous or next control in the group if the member function is successful.  \n  \n The returned pointer may be temporary and should not be stored for later use.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n A group of controls begins with a control that was created with the [WS_GROUP](../../mfc/reference/window-styles.md) style and ends with the last control that was not created with the **WS_GROUP** style.  \n  \n By default, the `GetNextDlgGroupItem` member function returns a pointer to the next control in the group. If `pWndCtl` identifies the first control in the group and `bPrevious` is **TRUE**, `GetNextDlgGroupItem` returns a pointer to the last control in the group.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  Because MFC supports windowless ActiveX controls, standard ActiveX controls, and windows, referring to a control by only an HWND no longer suffices. The `COleControlSiteOrWnd` object includes information that identifies the object as a windowed ActiveX control, a windowless ActiveX control, or a window, as follows:  \n  \n|Control or window type|Identifying information|  \n|----------------------------|-----------------------------|  \n|Windowed ActiveX control|Contains an HWND and associates a [COleControlSite](../../mfc/reference/colecontrolsite-class.md) object with it. The `m_hWnd` member of `COleControlSiteOrWnd` is set to the HWND of the control, and the **m_pSite** member points to the control's `COleControlSite`.|  \n|Windowless ActiveX control|Contains no `HWND`. The **m_pSite** member of `COleControlSiteOrWnd` points to the control's `COleControlSite`, and the **m_hWnd** member is **NULL**.|  \n|Standard window|Contains just an `HWND`. The `m_hWnd` member of `COleControlSiteOrWnd` is set to the `HWND` of the window, and the **m_pSite** member is **NULL**.|  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__getnextdlgtabitem\"></a>  CWnd::GetNextDlgTabItem  \n Retrieves a pointer to the first control that was created with the [WS_TABSTOP](window-styles.md) style and that precedes or follows the specified control.  \n  \n```  \nCWnd* GetNextDlgTabItem(\n    CWnd* pWndCtl,  \n    BOOL bPrevious = FALSE) const;\n\n \n \nCOleControlSiteOrWnd* GetNextDlgTabItem(\n    COleControlSiteOrWnd* pCurSiteOrWnd,  \n    BOOL bPrevious) const;\n\n \n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `pWndCtl`  \n Identifies the control to be used as the starting point for the search.  \n  \n `pCurSiteOrWnd`  \n Identifies the **COleControlSiteOrWnd** control. For more information about `COleControlSiteOrWnd`, see [CWnd::GetNextDlgGroupItem](#cwnd__getnextdlggroupitem).  \n  \n `bPrevious`  \n Specifies how the function is to search the dialog box. If **TRUE**, the function searches for the previous control in the dialog box; if **FALSE**, it searches for the next control.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Pointer to the previous or next control that has the **WS_TABSTOP** style, if the member function is successful.  \n  \n The returned pointer may be temporary and should not be stored for later use.  \n  \n For more information about `COleControlSiteOrWnd`, see [CWnd::GetNextDlgGroupItem](#cwnd__getnextdlggroupitem).  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__getnextwindow\"></a>  CWnd::GetNextWindow  \n Searches for the next (or previous) window in the window manager's list.  \n  \n```  \nCWnd* GetNextWindow(UINT nFlag = GW_HWNDNEXT) const;\n\n \n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `nFlag`  \n Specifies whether the function returns a pointer to the next window or the previous window. It can be either **GW_HWNDNEXT**, which returns the window that follows the `CWnd` object on the window manager's list, or **GW_HWNDPREV**, which returns the previous window on the window manager's list.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Identifies the next (or the previous) window in the window manager's list if the member function is successful.  \n  \n The returned pointer may be temporary and should not be stored for later use.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The window manager's list contains entries for all top-level windows, their associated child windows, and the child windows of any child windows.  \n  \n If `CWnd` is a top-level window, the function searches for the next (or previous) top-level window; if `CWnd` is a child window, the function searches for the next (or previous) child window.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__getolecontrolsite\"></a>  CWnd::GetOleControlSite  \n Retrieves the custom site for the specified ActiveX control.  \n  \n```  \nCOleControlSite* GetOleControlSite(UINT idControl) const;\n\n \n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `idControl`  \n The ID of the ActiveX control.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__getopenclipboardwindow\"></a>  CWnd::GetOpenClipboardWindow  \n Retrieves the handle of the window that currently has the Clipboard open.  \n  \n```  \nstatic CWnd* PASCAL GetOpenClipboardWindow();\n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n The handle of the window that currently has the Clipboard open if the function is successful; otherwise **NULL**.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__getowner\"></a>  CWnd::GetOwner  \n Retrieves a pointer to the owner of the window.  \n  \n```  \nCWnd* GetOwner() const;\n\n \n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n A pointer to a `CWnd` object.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n If the window has no owner, then a pointer to the parent window object is returned by default. Note that the relationship between the owner and the owned differs from the parent-child aspect in several important aspects. For example, a window with a parent is confined to its parent window's client area. Owned windows can be drawn at any location on the desktop.  \n  \n The ownership concept of this function is different from the ownership concept of [GetWindow](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms633515).  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__getparent\"></a>  CWnd::GetParent  \n Call this function to get a pointer to a child window's parent window (if any).  \n  \n```  \nCWnd* GetParent() const;\n\n \n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n See the Return Values section in [GetParent](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms633510) in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../../atl/includes/winsdk_md.md)].  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The `GetParent` function returns a pointer to the immediate parent (if it exists). In contrast, the [GetParentOwner](#cwnd__getparentowner) function returns a pointer to the most immediate parent or owner window that is not a child window (does not have the **WS_CHILD** style). If you have a child window within a child window `GetParent` and `GetParentOwner` return different results.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__getparentframe\"></a>  CWnd::GetParentFrame  \n Call this member function to retrieve the parent frame window.  \n  \n```  \nCFrameWnd* GetParentFrame() const;\n\n \n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n A pointer to a frame window if successful; otherwise **NULL**.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The member function searches up the parent chain until a [CFrameWnd](../../mfc/reference/cframewnd-class.md) (or derived class) object is found.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__getparentowner\"></a>  CWnd::GetParentOwner  \n Call this member function to get a pointer to a child window's parent window or owner window.  \n  \n```  \nCWnd* GetParentOwner() const;\n\n \n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n A pointer to a `CWnd` object. If a `CWnd` object is not attached to the handle, a temporary `CWnd` object is created and attached. The pointer may be temporary and should not be stored for later use.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n `GetParentOwner` returns a pointer to the most immediate parent or owner window that is not a child window (does not have the **WS_CHILD** style). The current owner window can be set with [SetOwner](#cwnd__setowner). By default, the parent of a window is its owner.  \n  \n In contrast, the [GetParent](#cwnd__getparent) function returns a pointer to the immediate parent, whether it is a child window or not. If you have a child window within a child window `GetParent` and `GetParentOwner` return different results.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__getproperty\"></a>  CWnd::GetProperty  \n Call this member function to get the ActiveX control property specified by `dwDispID`.  \n  \n```  \nvoid GetProperty(\n    DISPID dwDispID,  \n    VARTYPE vtProp,  \n    void* pvProp)const;\n\n \n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `dwDispID`  \n Identifies the property to be retrieved.  \n  \n `vtProp`  \n Specifies the type of the property to be retrieved. For possible values, see the Remarks section for [COleDispatchDriver::InvokeHelper](../../mfc/reference/coledispatchdriver-class.md#coledispatchdriver__invokehelper).  \n  \n `pvProp`  \n Address of the variable that will that will receive the property value. It must match the type specified by `vtProp`.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n **GetProperty** returns the value through `pvProp`.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  This function should be called only on a `CWnd` object that represents an ActiveX control.  \n  \n For more information about using this member function with ActiveX Control Containers, see the article [ActiveX Control Containers: Programming ActiveX Controls in an ActiveX Control Container](../../mfc/programming-activex-controls-in-a-activex-control-container.md).  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__getrendertarget\"></a>  CWnd::GetRenderTarget  \n Gets a render target that is associated with this window.  \n  \n```  \nCHwndRenderTarget* GetRenderTarget();\n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Pointer to the render target or NULL.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__getsafehwnd\"></a>  CWnd::GetSafeHwnd  \n Returns `m_hWnd`, or **NULL** if the **this** pointer is **NULL**.  \n  \n```  \nHWND GetSafeHwnd() const;\n\n \n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Returns the window handle for a window. Returns **NULL** if the `CWnd` is not attached to a window or if it is used with a **NULL CWnd** pointer.  \n  \n### Example  \n  See the example for [CWnd::SubclassWindow](#cwnd__subclasswindow).  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__getsafeowner\"></a>  CWnd::GetSafeOwner  \n Call this member function to retrieve the owner window that should be used for dialog boxes or other modal windows.  \n  \n```  \nstatic CWnd* GetSafeOwner(\n    CWnd* pParent = NULL,  \n    HWND* pWndTop = NULL);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `pParent`  \n A pointer to a parent `CWnd` window. May be **NULL**.  \n  \n *pWndTop*  \n A pointer to the window that is currently on top. May be **NULL**.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n A pointer to the safe owner for the given window.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The safe owner is the first non-child parent window of `pParent`. If `pParent` is **NULL**, the thread's main window (retrieved via [AfxGetMainWnd](../../mfc/reference/application-information-and-management.md#afxgetmainwnd)) is used to find an owner.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The framework itself uses this function to determine the correct owner window for dialog boxes and property sheets where the owner is not specified.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__getscrollbarctrl\"></a>  CWnd::GetScrollBarCtrl  \n Call this member function to obtain a pointer to the specified sibling scroll bar or splitter window.  \n  \n```  \nvirtual CScrollBar* GetScrollBarCtrl(int nBar) const;\n\n \n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `nBar`  \n Specifies the type of scroll bar. The parameter can take one of the following values:  \n  \n- **SB_HORZ** Retrieves the position of the horizontal scroll bar.  \n  \n- **SB_VERT** Retrieves the position of the vertical scroll bar.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n A sibling scroll-bar control, or **NULL** if none.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n This member function does not operate on scroll bars created when the **WS_HSCROLL** or **WS_VSCROLL** bits are set during the creation of a window. The `CWnd` implementation of this function simply returns **NULL**. Derived classes, such as `CView`, implement the described functionality.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__getscrollbarinfo\"></a>  CWnd::GetScrollBarInfo  \n Retrieves information about the specified scroll bar.  \n  \n```  \nBOOL GetScrollBarInfo(\n    LONG idObject,  \n    PSCROLLBARINFO psbi) const;\n\n \n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `idObject`  \n Specifies the menu object. For a list of possible values, see [GetScrollBarInfo](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb787581).  \n  \n *psbi*  \n Pointer to a [SCROLLBARINFO](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb787535) structure that receives the information.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Nonzero if the function succeeds; otherwise 0.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n This member function emulates the functionality of the function [GetScrollBarInfo](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb787581), as described in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../../atl/includes/winsdk_md.md)].  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__getscrollinfo\"></a>  CWnd::GetScrollInfo  \n Call this member function to retrieve the information that the `SCROLLINFO` structure maintains about a scroll bar.  \n  \n```  \nBOOL GetScrollInfo(\n    int nBar,  \n    LPSCROLLINFO lpScrollInfo,  \n    UINT nMask = SIF_ALL);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `nBar`  \n Specifies whether the scroll bar is a control or part of a window's nonclient area. If it is part of the nonclient area, `nBar` also indicates whether the scroll bar is positioned horizontally, vertically, or both. It must be one of the following:  \n  \n- **SB_CTL** Retrieves the parameters for a scroll bar control. The `m_hWnd` data member must be the handle of the scroll bar control.  \n  \n- **SB_HORZ** Retrieves the parameters for the window's standard horizontal scroll bar.  \n  \n- **SB_VERT** Retrieves the parameters for the window's standard vertical scroll bar.  \n  \n `lpScrollInfo`  \n A pointer to a [SCROLLINFO](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb787537) structure. See the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../../atl/includes/winsdk_md.md)] for more information about this structure.  \n  \n `nMask`  \n Specifies the scroll bar parameters to retrieve. The default specifies a combination of **SIF_PAGE**, **SIF_POS**, **SIF_TRACKPOS**, and **SIF_RANGE**. See `SCROLLINFO` for more information on the *nMask* values.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n If the message retrieved any values, the return is **TRUE**. Otherwise, it is **FALSE**.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n `GetScrollInfo` enables applications to use 32-bit scroll positions.  \n  \n The [SCROLLINFO](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb787537) structure contains information about a scroll bar, including the minimum and maximum scrolling positions, the page size, and the position of the scroll box (the thumb). See the `SCROLLINFO` structure topic in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../../atl/includes/winsdk_md.md)] for more information about changing the structure defaults.  \n  \n The MFC Windows message handlers that indicate scroll-bar position, [CWnd::OnHScroll](#cwnd__onhscroll) and [CWnd::OnVScroll](#cwnd__onvscroll), provide only 16 bits of position data. `GetScrollInfo` and `SetScrollInfo` provide 32 bits of scroll-bar position data. Thus, an application can call `GetScrollInfo` while processing either `CWnd::OnHScroll` or `CWnd::OnVScroll` to obtain 32-bit scroll-bar position data.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__getscrolllimit\"></a>  CWnd::GetScrollLimit  \n Call this member function to retrieve the maximum scrolling position of the scroll bar.  \n  \n```  \nint GetScrollLimit(int nBar);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `nBar`  \n Specifies the type of scroll bar. The parameter can take one of the following values:  \n  \n- **SB_HORZ** Retrieves the scroll limit of the horizontal scroll bar.  \n  \n- **SB_VERT** Retrieves the scroll limit of the vertical scroll bar.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Specifies the maximum position of a scroll bar if successful; otherwise 0.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__getscrollpos\"></a>  CWnd::GetScrollPos  \n Retrieves the current position of the scroll box of a scroll bar.  \n  \n```  \nint GetScrollPos(int nBar) const;\n\n \n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `nBar`  \n Specifies the scroll bar to examine. The parameter can take one of the following values:  \n  \n- **SB_HORZ** Retrieves the position of the horizontal scroll bar.  \n  \n- **SB_VERT** Retrieves the position of the vertical scroll bar.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Specifies the current position of the scroll box in the scroll bar if successful; otherwise 0.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The current position is a relative value that depends on the current scrolling range. For example, if the scrolling range is 50 to 100 and the scroll box is in the middle of the bar, the current position is 75.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__getscrollrange\"></a>  CWnd::GetScrollRange  \n Copies the current minimum and maximum scroll-bar positions for the given scroll bar to the locations specified by `lpMinPos` and `lpMaxPos`.  \n  \n```  \nvoid GetScrollRange(\n    int nBar,  \n    LPINT lpMinPos,  \n    LPINT lpMaxPos) const;\n\n \n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `nBar`  \n Specifies the scroll bar to examine. The parameter can take one of the following values:  \n  \n- **SB_HORZ** Retrieves the position of the horizontal scroll bar.  \n  \n- **SB_VERT** Retrieves the position of the vertical scroll bar.  \n  \n `lpMinPos`  \n Points to the integer variable that is to receive the minimum position.  \n  \n `lpMaxPos`  \n Points to the integer variable that is to receive the maximum position.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n If `CWnd` does not have a scroll bar, then the `GetScrollRange` member function copies 0 to `lpMinPos` and `lpMaxPos`.  \n  \n The default range for a standard scroll bar is 0 to 100. The default range for a scroll-bar control is empty (both values are 0).  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__getstyle\"></a>  CWnd::GetStyle  \n Returns the current window style.  \n  \n```  \nDWORD GetStyle() const;\n\n \n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n The window's style. For more information about the window styles used in MFC, see [Window Styles](../../mfc/reference/window-styles.md).  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__getsystemmenu\"></a>  CWnd::GetSystemMenu  \n Allows the application to access the Control menu for copying and modification.  \n  \n```  \nCMenu* GetSystemMenu(BOOL bRevert) const;\n\n \n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `bRevert`  \n Specifies the action to be taken. If `bRevert` is **FALSE**, `GetSystemMenu` returns a handle to a copy of the Control menu currently in use. This copy is initially identical to the Control menu but can be modified. If `bRevert` is **TRUE**, `GetSystemMenu` resets the Control menu back to the default state. The previous, possibly modified, Control menu, if any, is destroyed. The return value is undefined in this case.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Identifies a copy of the Control menu if `bRevert` is **FALSE**. If `bRevert` is **TRUE**, the return value is undefined.  \n  \n The returned pointer may be temporary and should not be stored for later use.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n Any window that does not use `GetSystemMenu` to make its own copy of the Control menu receives the standard Control menu.  \n  \n The pointer returned by the `GetSystemMenu` member function can be used with the [CMenu::AppendMenu](../../mfc/reference/cmenu-class.md#cmenu__appendmenu), [CMenu::InsertMenu](../../mfc/reference/cmenu-class.md#cmenu__insertmenu), or [CMenu::ModifyMenu](../../mfc/reference/cmenu-class.md#cmenu__modifymenu) functions to change the Control menu.  \n  \n The Control menu initially contains items identified with various ID values such as **SC_CLOSE**, **SC_MOVE**, and **SC_SIZE**. Items on the Control menu generate [WM_SYSCOMMAND](#cwnd__onsyscommand) messages. All predefined Control-menu items have ID numbers greater than 0xF000. If an application adds items to the Control menu, it should use ID numbers less than F000.  \n  \n Windows may automatically make items unavailable on the standard Control menu. `CWnd` can carry out its own selection or unavailability by responding to the [WM_INITMENU](#cwnd__oninitmenu) messages, which are sent before any menu is displayed.  \n  \n### Example  \n [!code-cpp[NVC_MFCWindowing#99](../../mfc/reference/codesnippet/cpp/cwnd-class_39.cpp)]  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__gettitlebarinfo\"></a>  CWnd::GetTitleBarInfo  \n Retrieves information about the specified title bar.  \n  \n```  \nBOOL GetTitleBarInfo(PTITLEBARINFO pti) const;\n\n \n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n *pti*  \n Pointer to a [TITLEBARINFO](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms632608) structure that receives the information.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n This member function emulates the functionality of the function [GetTitleBarInfo](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms633513), as described in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../../atl/includes/winsdk_md.md)].  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__gettoplevelframe\"></a>  CWnd::GetTopLevelFrame  \n Call this member function to retrieve the window's top level frame window, if any.  \n  \n```  \nCFrameWnd* GetTopLevelFrame() const;\n\n \n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Identifies the top-level frame window of the window.  \n  \n The returned pointer may be temporary and should not be stored for later use.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n If `CWnd` has no attached window, or its top-level parent is not a [CFrameWnd](../../mfc/reference/cframewnd-class.md)-derived object, this function returns **NULL**.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__gettoplevelowner\"></a>  CWnd::GetTopLevelOwner  \n Call this member function to retrieve the top-level window.  \n  \n```  \nCWnd* GetTopLevelOwner() const;\n\n \n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Identifies the top-level window. The returned pointer may be temporary and should not be stored for later use.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The top-level window is the window that is a child of the desktop. If `CWnd` has no attached window, this function returns **NULL**.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__gettoplevelparent\"></a>  CWnd::GetTopLevelParent  \n Call this member function to retrieve the window's top-level parent.  \n  \n```  \nCWnd* GetTopLevelParent() const;\n\n \n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Identifies the top-level parent window of the window.  \n  \n The returned pointer may be temporary and should not be stored for later use.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n `GetTopLevelParent` is similar to [GetTopLevelFrame](#cwnd__gettoplevelframe) and [GetTopLevelOwner](#cwnd__gettoplevelowner); however, it ignores the value set as the current owner window.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__gettopwindow\"></a>  CWnd::GetTopWindow  \n Searches for the top-level child window that belongs to `CWnd`.  \n  \n```  \nCWnd* GetTopWindow() const;\n\n \n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Identifies the top-level child window in a `CWnd` linked list of child windows. If no child windows exist, the value is **NULL**.  \n  \n The returned pointer may be temporary and should not be stored for later use.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n If `CWnd` has no children, this function returns **NULL**.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__getupdaterect\"></a>  CWnd::GetUpdateRect  \n Retrieves the coordinates of the smallest rectangle that completely encloses the update region.  \n  \n```  \nBOOL GetUpdateRect(\n    LPRECT lpRect,  \n    BOOL bErase = FALSE);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `lpRect`  \n Points to a `CRect` object or [RECT structure](../../mfc/reference/rect-structure1.md) that is to receive the client coordinates of the update that encloses the update region.  \n  \n Set this parameter to **NULL** to determine whether an update region exists within the `CWnd`. If `lpRect` is **NULL**, the `GetUpdateRect` member function returns nonzero if an update region exists and 0 if one does not. This provides a way to determine whether a `WM_PAINT` message resulted from an invalid area. Do not set this parameter to **NULL** in Windows version 3.0 and earlier.  \n  \n `bErase`  \n Specifies whether the background in the update region is to be erased.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Specifies the status of the update region. The value is nonzero if the update region is not empty; otherwise 0.  \n  \n If the `lpRect` parameter is set to **NULL**, the return value is nonzero if an update region exists; otherwise 0.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n If `CWnd` was created with the **CS_OWNDC** style and the mapping mode is not `MM_TEXT`, the `GetUpdateRect` member function gives the rectangle in logical coordinates. Otherwise, `GetUpdateRect` gives the rectangle in client coordinates. If there is no update region, `GetUpdateRect` sets the rectangle to be empty (sets all coordinates to 0).  \n  \n The `bErase` parameter specifies whether `GetUpdateRect` should erase the background of the update region. If `bErase` is **TRUE** and the update region is not empty, the background is erased. To erase the background, `GetUpdateRect` sends the [WM_ERASEBKGND](#cwnd__onerasebkgnd) message.  \n  \n The update rectangle retrieved by the [BeginPaint](#cwnd__beginpaint) member function is identical to that retrieved by the `GetUpdateRect` member function.  \n  \n The `BeginPaint` member function automatically validates the update region, so any call to `GetUpdateRect` made immediately after a call to `BeginPaint` retrieves an empty update region.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__getupdatergn\"></a>  CWnd::GetUpdateRgn  \n Retrieves the update region into a region identified by `pRgn`.  \n  \n```  \nint GetUpdateRgn(\n    CRgn* pRgn,  \n    BOOL bErase = FALSE);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `pRgn`  \n Identifies the update region.  \n  \n `bErase`  \n Specifies whether the background will be erased and nonclient areas of child windows will be drawn. If the value is **FALSE**, no drawing is done.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Specifies a short-integer flag that indicates the type of resulting region. The value can take any one of the following:  \n  \n- **SIMPLEREGION** The region has no overlapping borders.  \n  \n- **COMPLEXREGION** The region has overlapping borders.  \n  \n- **NULLREGION** The region is empty.  \n  \n- **ERROR** No region was created.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The coordinates of this region are relative to the upper-left corner (client coordinates).  \n  \n The [BeginPaint](#cwnd__beginpaint) member function automatically validates the update region, so any call to `GetUpdateRgn` made immediately after a call to `BeginPaint` retrieves an empty update region.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__getwindow\"></a>  CWnd::GetWindow  \n Returns a pointer to the window requested, or **NULL** if none.  \n  \n```  \nCWnd* GetWindow(UINT nCmd) const;\n\n \n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `nCmd`  \n Specifies the relationship between `CWnd` and the returned window. It can take one of the following values:  \n  \n- **GW_CHILD** Identifies the `CWnd` first child window.  \n  \n- **GW_HWNDFIRST** If `CWnd` is a child window, returns the first sibling window. Otherwise, it returns the first top-level window in the list.  \n  \n- **GW_HWNDLAST** If `CWnd` is a child window, returns the last sibling window. Otherwise, it returns the last top-level window in the list.  \n  \n- **GW_HWNDNEXT** Returns the next window on the window manager's list.  \n  \n- **GW_HWNDPREV** Returns the previous window on the window manager's list.  \n  \n- **GW_OWNER** Identifies the `CWnd` owner.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n The returned pointer may be temporary and should not be stored for later use.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__getwindowcontexthelpid\"></a>  CWnd::GetWindowContextHelpId  \n Call this member function to retrieve the help context identifier, if any, associated with the window.  \n  \n```  \nDWORD GetWindowContextHelpId() const;\n\n \n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n The help context identifier. Returns 0 if the window has none.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__getwindowedchildcount\"></a>  CWnd::GetWindowedChildCount  \n Call this member function to retrieve the number of associated child windows.  \n  \n```  \nlong GetWindowedChildCount();\n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n The number of child windows associated with the `CWnd` object.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__getwindowdc\"></a>  CWnd::GetWindowDC  \n Retrieves the display context for the entire window, including caption bar, menus, and scroll bars.  \n  \n```  \nCDC* GetWindowDC();\n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Identifies the display context for the given window if the function is successful; otherwise **NULL**.  \n  \n The returned pointer may be temporary and should not be stored for later use. [ReleaseDC](#cwnd__releasedc) should be called once for each successful call to `GetWindowDC`.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n A window display context permits painting anywhere in `CWnd`, since the origin of the context is the upper-left corner of `CWnd` instead of the client area.  \n  \n Default attributes are assigned to the display context each time it retrieves the context. Previous attributes are lost.  \n  \n `GetWindowDC` is intended to be used for special painting effects within the `CWnd` nonclient area. Painting in nonclient areas of any window is not recommended.  \n  \n The [GetSystemMetrics](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms724385) Windows function can be used to retrieve the dimensions of various parts of the nonclient area, such as the caption bar, menu, and scroll bars.  \n  \n After painting is complete, the [ReleaseDC](#cwnd__releasedc) member function must be called to release the display context. Failure to release the display context will seriously affect painting requested by applications due to limitations on the number of device contexts that can be open at the same time.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__getwindowinfo\"></a>  CWnd::GetWindowInfo  \n Retrieves information about the window.  \n  \n```  \nBOOL GetWindowInfo(PWINDOWINFO pwi) const;\n\n \n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n *pwi*  \n A pointer to a [WINDOWINFO](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms632610) structure.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n This member function emulates the functionality of the function [GetWindowInfo](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms633516), as described in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../../atl/includes/winsdk_md.md)].  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__getwindowlesschildcount\"></a>  CWnd::GetWindowlessChildCount  \n Retrieves the number of associated windowless child windows.  \n  \n```  \nlong GetWindowlessChildCount();\n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n The number of windowless child windows associated with the `CWnd` object.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__getwindowplacement\"></a>  CWnd::GetWindowPlacement  \n Retrieves the show state and the normal (restored), minimized, and maximized positions of a window.  \n  \n```  \nBOOL GetWindowPlacement(WINDOWPLACEMENT* lpwndpl) const;\n\n \n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `lpwndpl`  \n Points to the `WINDOWPLACEMENT` structure that receives the show state and position information.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Nonzero if the function is successful; otherwise 0.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The **flags** member of the [WINDOWPLACEMENT](../../mfc/reference/windowplacement-structure.md) structure retrieved by this function is always 0. If `CWnd` is maximized, the **showCmd** member of `WINDOWPLACEMENT` is **SW_SHOWMAXIMIZED**. If the window is minimized, it is **SW_SHOWMINIMIZED.** It is **SW_SHOWNORMAL** otherwise.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__getwindowrect\"></a>  CWnd::GetWindowRect  \n Copies the dimensions of the bounding rectangle of the `CWnd` object to the structure pointed to by `lpRect`.  \n  \n```  \nvoid GetWindowRect(LPRECT lpRect) const;\n\n \n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `lpRect`  \n Points to a `CRect` object or a [RECT structure](../../mfc/reference/rect-structure1.md) that will receive the screen coordinates of the upper-left and lower-right corners.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The dimensions are given in screen coordinates relative to the upper-left corner of the display screen. The dimensions of the caption, border, and scroll bars, if present, are included.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__getwindowrgn\"></a>  CWnd::GetWindowRgn  \n Call this member function to get the window region of a window.  \n  \n```  \nint GetWindowRgn(HRGN hRgn)const;\n\n \n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `hRgn`  \n A handle to a window region.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n The return value specifies the type of the region that the function obtains. It can be one of the following values:  \n  \n- **NULLREGION** The region is empty.  \n  \n- **SIMPLEREGION** The region is a single rectangle.  \n  \n- **COMPLEXREGION** The region is more than one rectangle.  \n  \n- **ERROR** An error occurred; the region is unaffected.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The window region determines the area within the window where the operating system permits drawing. The operating system does not display any portion of a window that lies outside of the window region.  \n  \n The coordinates of a window's window region are relative to the upper-left corner of the window, not the client area of the window.  \n  \n To set the window region of a window, call [CWnd::SetWindowRgn](#cwnd__setwindowrgn).  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__getwindowtext\"></a>  CWnd::GetWindowText  \n Copies the `CWnd` caption title (if it has one) into the buffer pointed to by `lpszStringBuf` or into the destination string `rString`.  \n  \n```  \nint GetWindowText(\n    LPTSTR lpszStringBuf,  \n    int nMaxCount) const;\n\n \n \nvoid GetWindowText(\n    CString& rString) const;\n\n \n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `lpszStringBuf`  \n Points to the buffer that is to receive the copied string of the window's title.  \n  \n `nMaxCount`  \n Specifies the maximum number of characters to be copied to the buffer, including the terminating null character. If the string is longer than the number of characters specified in `nMaxCount`, it is truncated.  \n  \n `rString`  \n A [CString](../../atl-mfc-shared/reference/cstringt-class.md) object that is to receive the copied string of the window's title.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Specifies the length, in characters, of the copied string, not including the terminating null character. It is 0 if `CWnd` has no caption or if the caption is empty.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n If the `CWnd` object is a control, the `GetWindowText` member function copies the text within the control instead of copying the caption.  \n  \n This member function causes the [WM_GETTEXT](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms632627) message to be sent to the `CWnd` object.  \n  \n### Example  \n  See the example for [CWnd::SetWindowText](#cwnd__setwindowtext).  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__getwindowtextlength\"></a>  CWnd::GetWindowTextLength  \n Returns the length of the `CWnd` object caption title.  \n  \n```  \nint GetWindowTextLength() const;\n\n \n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Specifies the text length in characters, not including any null-termination character. The value is 0 if no such text exists.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n If `CWnd` is a control, the `GetWindowTextLength` member function returns the length of the text within the control instead of the caption.  \n  \n This member function causes the [WM_GETTEXTLENGTH](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms632628) message to be sent to the `CWnd` object.  \n  \n### Example  \n  See the example for [CWnd::SetWindowText](#cwnd__setwindowtext).  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__hidecaret\"></a>  CWnd::HideCaret  \n Hides the caret by removing it from the display screen.  \n  \n```  \nvoid HideCaret();\n```  \n  \n### Remarks  \n Although the caret is no longer visible, it can be displayed again by using the [ShowCaret](#cwnd__showcaret) member function. Hiding the caret does not destroy its current shape.  \n  \n Hiding is cumulative. If `HideCaret` has been called five times in a row, the `ShowCaret` member function must be called five times before the caret will be shown.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__hilitemenuitem\"></a>  CWnd::HiliteMenuItem  \n Highlights or removes the highlight from a top-level (menu-bar) menu item.  \n  \n```  \nBOOL HiliteMenuItem(\n    CMenu* pMenu,  \n    UINT nIDHiliteItem,  \n    UINT nHilite);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `pMenu`  \n Identifies the top-level menu that contains the item to be highlighted.  \n  \n `nIDHiliteItem`  \n Specifies the menu item to be highlighted, depending on the value of the `nHilite` parameter.  \n  \n `nHilite`  \n Specifies whether the menu item is highlighted or the highlight is removed. It can be a combination of **MF_HILITE** or **MF_UNHILITE** with **MF_BYCOMMAND** or **MF_BYPOSITION**. The values can be combined using the bitwise OR operator. These values have the following meanings:  \n  \n- **MF_BYCOMMAND** Interprets `nIDHiliteItem` as the menu-item ID (the default interpretation).  \n  \n- **MF_BYPOSITION** Interprets `nIDHiliteItem` as the zero-based offset of the menu item.  \n  \n- **MF_HILITE** Highlights the item. If this value is not given, the highlight is removed from the item.  \n  \n- **MF_UNHILITE** Removes the highlight from the item.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Specifies whether the menu item was highlighted. Nonzero if the item was highlighted; otherwise 0.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The **MF_HILITE** and **MF_UNHILITE** flags can be used only with this member function; they cannot be used with the [CMenu::ModifyMenu](../../mfc/reference/cmenu-class.md#cmenu__modifymenu) member function.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__htmlhelp\"></a>  CWnd::HtmlHelp  \n Call this member function to invoke the HTMLHelp application.  \n  \n```  \nvirtual void HtmlHelp(\n    DWORD_PTR dwData,  \n    UINT nCmd = 0x000F);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `dwData`  \n Specifies additional data. The value used depends on the value of the `nCmd` parameter.  \n  \n `nCmd`  \n Specifies the type of help requested. For a list of possible values and how they affect the `dwData` parameter, see the `uCommand` parameter described in the HTML Help API Reference in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../../atl/includes/winsdk_md.md)].  \n  \n### Remarks  \n See [CWinApp::HtmlHelp](../../mfc/reference/cwinapp-class.md#cwinapp__htmlhelp) for more information.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__initdynamiclayout\"></a>  CWnd::InitDynamicLayout  \n Called by the framework to initialize dynamic layout for a window.  \n  \n```  \nvoid InitDynamicLayout();\n```  \n  \n### Remarks  \n Do not call this method directly.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__invalidate\"></a>  CWnd::Invalidate  \n Invalidates the entire client area of `CWnd`.  \n  \n```  \nvoid Invalidate(BOOL bErase = TRUE);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `bErase`  \n Specifies whether the background within the update region is to be erased.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The client area is marked for painting when the next [WM_PAINT](#cwnd__onpaint) message occurs. The region can also be validated before a `WM_PAINT` message occurs by the [ValidateRect](#cwnd__validaterect) or [ValidateRgn](#cwnd__validatergn) member function.  \n  \n The `bErase` parameter specifies whether the background within the update area is to be erased when the update region is processed. If `bErase` is **TRUE**, the background is erased when the [BeginPaint](#cwnd__beginpaint) member function is called; if `bErase` is **FALSE**, the background remains unchanged. If `bErase` is **TRUE** for any part of the update region, the background in the entire region, not just in the given part, is erased.  \n  \n Windows sends a [WM_PAINT](#cwnd__onpaint) message whenever the `CWnd` update region is not empty and there are no other messages in the application queue for that window.  \n  \n### Example  \n  See the example for [CWnd::UpdateWindow](#cwnd__updatewindow).  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__invalidaterect\"></a>  CWnd::InvalidateRect  \n Invalidates the client area within the given rectangle by adding that rectangle to the `CWnd` update region.  \n  \n```  \nvoid InvalidateRect(\n    LPCRECT lpRect,  \n    BOOL bErase = TRUE);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `lpRect`  \n Points to a `CRect` object or a [RECT structure](../../mfc/reference/rect-structure1.md) that contains the rectangle (in client coordinates) to be added to the update region. If `lpRect` is **NULL**, the entire client area is added to the region.  \n  \n `bErase`  \n Specifies whether the background within the update region is to be erased.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The invalidated rectangle, along with all other areas in the update region, is marked for painting when the next [WM_PAINT](#cwnd__onpaint) message is sent. The invalidated areas accumulate in the update region until the region is processed when the next `WM_PAINT` call occurs, or until the region is validated by the [ValidateRect](#cwnd__validaterect) or [ValidateRgn](#cwnd__validatergn) member function.  \n  \n The `bErase` parameter specifies whether the background within the update area is to be erased when the update region is processed. If `bErase` is **TRUE**, the background is erased when the [BeginPaint](#cwnd__beginpaint) member function is called; if `bErase` is **FALSE**, the background remains unchanged. If `bErase` is **TRUE** for any part of the update region, the background in the entire region is erased, not just in the given part.  \n  \n Windows sends a [WM_PAINT](#cwnd__onpaint) message whenever the `CWnd` update region is not empty and there are no other messages in the application queue for that window.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__invalidatergn\"></a>  CWnd::InvalidateRgn  \n Invalidates the client area within the given region by adding it to the current update region of `CWnd`.  \n  \n```  \nvoid InvalidateRgn(\n    CRgn* pRgn,  \n    BOOL bErase = TRUE);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `pRgn`  \n A pointer to a [CRgn](../../mfc/reference/crgn-class.md) object that identifies the region to be added to the update region. The region is assumed to have client coordinates. If this parameter is **NULL**, the entire client area is added to the update region.  \n  \n `bErase`  \n Specifies whether the background within the update region is to be erased.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The invalidated region, along with all other areas in the update region, is marked for painting when the [WM_PAINT](#cwnd__onpaint) message is next sent. The invalidated areas accumulate in the update region until the region is processed when a `WM_PAINT` message is next sent, or until the region is validated by the [ValidateRect](#cwnd__validaterect) or [ValidateRgn](#cwnd__validatergn) member function.  \n  \n The `bErase` parameter specifies whether the background within the update area is to be erased when the update region is processed. If `bErase` is **TRUE**, the background is erased when the [BeginPaint](#cwnd__beginpaint) member function is called; if `bErase` is **FALSE**, the background remains unchanged. If `bErase` is **TRUE** for any part of the update region, the background in the entire region, not just in the given part, is erased.  \n  \n Windows sends a [WM_PAINT](#cwnd__onpaint) message whenever the `CWnd` update region is not empty and there are no other messages in the application queue for that window.  \n  \n The given region must have been previously created by one of the region functions.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__invokehelper\"></a>  CWnd::InvokeHelper  \n Call this member function to invoke the ActiveX Control method or property specified by `dwDispID`, in the context specified by `wFlags`.  \n  \n```  \nvoid AFX_CDECL InvokeHelper(\n    DISPID dwDispID,  \n    WORD wFlags,  \n    VARTYPE vtRet,  \n    void* pvRet,  \n    const BYTE* pbParamInfo,  \n ...);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `dwDispID`  \n Identifies the method or property to be invoked.  \n  \n `wFlags`  \n Flags describing the context of the call to **IDispatch::Invoke**.  \n  \n `vtRet`  \n Specifies the type of the return value. For possible values, see the Remarks section for [COleDispatchDriver::InvokeHelper](../../mfc/reference/coledispatchdriver-class.md#coledispatchdriver__invokehelper).  \n  \n `pvRet`  \n Address of the variable that will that will receive the property value or return value. It must match the type specified by `vtRet`.  \n  \n `pbParamInfo`  \n Pointer to a null-terminated string of bytes specifying the types of the parameters following `pbParamInfo`. For possible values, see the Remarks section for `COleDispatchDriver::InvokeHelper`.  \n  \n *...*  \n Variable List of parameters, of types specified in `pbParamInfo`.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The `pbParamInfo` parameter specifies the types of the parameters passed to the method or property. The variable list of arguments is represented by *...* in the syntax declaration.  \n  \n This function converts the parameters to **VARIANTARG** values, then invokes the **IDispatch::Invoke** method on the ActiveX control. If the call to **IDispatch::Invoke** fails, this function will throw an exception. If the `SCODE` (status code) returned by **IDispatch::Invoke** is `DISP_E_EXCEPTION`, this function throws a [COleException](../../mfc/reference/coleexception-class.md) object, otherwise it throws a [COleDispatchException](../../mfc/reference/coledispatchexception-class.md).  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  This function should be called only on a `CWnd` object that represents an ActiveX control.  \n  \n For more information about using this member function with ActiveX Control Containers, see the article [ActiveX Control Containers: Programming ActiveX Controls in an ActiveX Control Container](../../mfc/programming-activex-controls-in-a-activex-control-container.md).  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__ischild\"></a>  CWnd::IsChild  \n Indicates whether the window specified by `pWnd` is a child window or other direct descendant of `CWnd`.  \n  \n```  \nBOOL IsChild(const CWnd* pWnd) const;\n\n \n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `pWnd`  \n Identifies the window to be tested.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Specifies the outcome of the function. The value is nonzero if the window identified by `pWnd` is a child window of `CWnd`; otherwise 0.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n A child window is the direct descendant of `CWnd` if the `CWnd` object is in the chain of parent windows that leads from the original pop-up window to the child window.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__isd2dsupportenabled\"></a>  CWnd::IsD2DSupportEnabled  \n Determines whether D2D support is enabled.  \n  \n```  \nBOOL IsD2DSupportEnabled();\n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n TRUE if the feature is enabled; otherwise FALSE.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__isdialogmessage\"></a>  CWnd::IsDialogMessage  \n Call this member function to determine whether the given message is intended for a modeless dialog box; if it is, this function processes the message.  \n  \n```  \nBOOL IsDialogMessage(LPMSG lpMsg);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `lpMsg`  \n Points to an [MSG](../../mfc/reference/msg-structure1.md) structure that contains the message to be checked.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Specifies whether the member function has processed the given message. It is nonzero if the message has been processed; otherwise 0. If the return is 0, call the [CWnd::PreTranslateMessage](#cwnd__pretranslatemessage) member function of the base class to process the message. In an override of the `CWnd::PreTranslateMessage` member function the code looks like this :  \n  \n [!code-cpp[NVC_MFCWindowing#100](../../mfc/reference/codesnippet/cpp/cwnd-class_40.cpp)]  \n  \n### Remarks  \n When the `IsDialogMessage` function processes a message, it checks for keyboard messages and converts them to selection commands for the corresponding dialog box. For example, the TAB key selects the next control or group of controls, and the DOWN ARROW key selects the next control in a group.  \n  \n You must not pass a message processed by `IsDialogMessage` to the [TranslateMessage](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms644955) or [DispatchMessage](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms644934) Windows functions, because it has already been processed.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__isdlgbuttonchecked\"></a>  CWnd::IsDlgButtonChecked  \n Determines whether a button control has a check mark next to it.  \n  \n```  \nUINT IsDlgButtonChecked(int nIDButton) const;\n\n \n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `nIDButton`  \n Specifies the integer identifier of the button control.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Nonzero if the given control is checked, and 0 if it is not checked. Only radio buttons and check boxes can be checked. For three-state buttons, the return value can be 2 if the button is indeterminate. This member function returns 0 for a pushbutton.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n If the button is a three-state control, the member function determines whether it is dimmed, checked, or neither.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__isdynamiclayoutenabled\"></a>  CWnd::IsDynamicLayoutEnabled  \n Determines whether dynamic layout is enabled on this window. If dynamic layout is enabled, the position and size of child windows can change when the user resizes the parent window.  \n  \n```  \nBOOL IsDynamicLayoutEnabled() const;\n\n \n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n TRUE if dynamic layout is enabled; otherwise FALSE.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__isiconic\"></a>  CWnd::IsIconic  \n Specifies whether `CWnd` is minimized (iconic).  \n  \n```  \nBOOL IsIconic() const;\n\n \n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Nonzero if `CWnd` is minimized; otherwise 0.  \n  \n### Example  \n [!code-cpp[NVC_MFCWindowing#101](../../mfc/reference/codesnippet/cpp/cwnd-class_41.cpp)]  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__istouchwindow\"></a>  CWnd::IsTouchWindow  \n Specifies whether `CWnd` has touch support.  \n  \n```  \nBOOL IsTouchWindow() const;\n\n \n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n `TRUE` if `CWnd` has touch support; otherwise `FALSE`.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__iswindowenabled\"></a>  CWnd::IsWindowEnabled  \n Specifies whether `CWnd` is enabled for mouse and keyboard input.  \n  \n```  \nBOOL IsWindowEnabled() const;\n\n \n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Nonzero if `CWnd` is enabled; otherwise 0.  \n  \n### Example  \n [!code-cpp[NVC_MFCWindowing#102](../../mfc/reference/codesnippet/cpp/cwnd-class_42.cpp)]  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__iswindowvisible\"></a>  CWnd::IsWindowVisible  \n Determines the visibility state of the given window.  \n  \n```  \nBOOL IsWindowVisible() const;\n\n \n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Nonzero if `CWnd` is visible (has the [WS_VISIBLE](../../mfc/reference/window-styles.md) style bit set, and parent window is visible). Because the return value reflects the state of the **WS_VISIBLE** style bit, the return value may be nonzero even though `CWnd` is totally obscured by other windows.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n A window possesses a visibility state indicated by the **WS_VISIBLE** style bit. When this style bit is set with a call to the [ShowWindow](#cwnd__showwindow) member function, the window is displayed and subsequent drawing to the window is displayed as long as the window has the style bit set.  \n  \n Any drawing to a window that has the **WS_VISIBLE** style will not be displayed if the window is covered by other windows or is clipped by its parent window.  \n  \n### Example  \n [!code-cpp[NVC_MFCWindowing#103](../../mfc/reference/codesnippet/cpp/cwnd-class_43.cpp)]  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__iszoomed\"></a>  CWnd::IsZoomed  \n Determines whether `CWnd` has been maximized.  \n  \n```  \nBOOL IsZoomed() const;\n\n \n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Nonzero if `CWnd` is maximized; otherwise 0.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__killtimer\"></a>  CWnd::KillTimer  \n Kills the timer event identified by `nIDEvent` from the earlier call to `SetTimer`.  \n  \n```  \nBOOL KillTimer(UINT_PTR nIDEvent);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `nIDEvent`  \n The value of the timer event passed to [SetTimer](#cwnd__settimer).  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Specifies the outcome of the function. The value is nonzero if the event was killed. It is 0 if the `KillTimer` member function could not find the specified timer event.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n Pending [WM_TIMER](#cwnd__ontimer) messages associated with the timer are not removed from the message queue.  \n  \n### Example  \n  See the example for [CWnd::SetTimer](#cwnd__settimer).  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__loaddynamiclayoutresource\"></a>  CWnd::LoadDynamicLayoutResource  \n Called by the framework to load dynamic layout information from the resource file.  \n  \n```  \nBOOL LoadDynamicLayoutResource(LPCTSTR lpszResourceName);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `lpszResourceName`  \n The name of the resource that contains the desired dynamic layout information for this window.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Nonzero if the function is successful. It is 0 if a failure occurs.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n Do not call this method directly.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__lockwindowupdate\"></a>  CWnd::LockWindowUpdate  \n Disables drawing in the given window.  \n  \n```  \nBOOL LockWindowUpdate();\n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Nonzero if the function is successful. It is 0 if a failure occurs or if the `LockWindowUpdate` function has been used to lock another window.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n A locked window cannot be moved. Only one window can be locked at a time. To unlock a window locked with `LockWindowUpdate`, call [UnlockWindowUpdate](#cwnd__unlockwindowupdate).  \n  \n If an application with a locked window (or any locked child windows) calls the [GetDC,](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd144871) [GetDCEx,](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd144873) or [BeginPaint](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd183362) Windows function, the called function returns a device context whose visible region is empty. This will occur until the application unlocks the window by calling the `UnlockWindowUpdate` member function.  \n  \n While window updates are locked, the system keeps track of the bounding rectangle of any drawing operations to device contexts associated with a locked window. When drawing is reenabled, this bounding rectangle is invalidated in the locked window and its child windows to force an eventual [WM_PAINT](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd145213) message to update the screen. If no drawing has occurred while the window updates were locked, no area is invalidated.  \n  \n The `LockWindowUpdate` member function does not make the given window invisible and does not clear the [WS_VISIBLE](../../mfc/reference/window-styles.md) style bit.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__m_hwnd\"></a>  CWnd::m_hWnd  \n The handle of the Windows window attached to this `CWnd`.  \n  \n```  \nHWND m_hWnd;  \n```  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The `m_hWnd` data member is a public variable of type `HWND`.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__mapwindowpoints\"></a>  CWnd::MapWindowPoints  \n Converts (maps) a set of points from the coordinate space of the `CWnd` to the coordinate space of another window.  \n  \n```  \nvoid MapWindowPoints(\n    CWnd* pwndTo,  \n    LPRECT lpRect) const;\n\n \n \nvoid MapWindowPoints(\n    CWnd* pwndTo,  \n    LPPOINT lpPoint,  \n    UINT nCount) const;\n\n \n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n *pwndTo*  \n Identifies the window to which points are converted. If this parameter is **NULL**, the points are converted to screen coordinates.  \n  \n `lpRect`  \n Specifies the rectangle whose points are to be converted. The first version of this function is available only for Windows 3.1 and later.  \n  \n `lpPoint`  \n A pointer to an array of [POINT structure](../../mfc/reference/point-structure1.md) that contain the set of points to be converted.  \n  \n `nCount`  \n Specifies the number of **POINT** structures in the array pointed to by `lpPoint`.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__messagebox\"></a>  CWnd::MessageBox  \n Creates and displays a window that contains an application-supplied message and caption, plus a combination of the predefined icons and pushbuttons described in the [Message-Box Styles](../../mfc/reference/message-box-styles.md) list.  \n  \n```  \nint MessageBox(\n    LPCTSTR lpszText,  \n    LPCTSTR lpszCaption = NULL,  \n    UINT nType = MB_OK);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `lpszText`  \n Points to a `CString` object or null-terminated string containing the message to be displayed.  \n  \n `lpszCaption`  \n Points to a `CString` object or null-terminated string to be used for the message-box caption. If `lpszCaption` is **NULL**, the default caption \"Error\" is used.  \n  \n `nType`  \n Specifies the contents and behavior of the message box.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n This method utilizes the [MessageBox](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms645505) function as defined in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../../atl/includes/winsdk_md.md)]. This method returns the result of calling this function.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n Use the global function [AfxMessageBox](../../mfc/reference/cstring-formatting-and-message-box-display.md#afxmessagebox) instead of this member function to implement a message box in your application.  \n  \n The following shows the various system icons that can be used in a message box:  \n  \n|||  \n|-|-|  \n|![Stop &#40;x&#41; icon](../../mfc/reference/media/vc364f1.gif \"vc364f1\")|**MB_ICONHAND**, **MB_ICONSTOP**, and **MB_ICONERROR**|  \n|![Help &#40;&#41; icon](../../mfc/reference/media/vc364f2.gif \"vc364f2\")|**MB_ICONQUESTION**|  \n|![Important &#40;&#33;&#41; icon](../../mfc/reference/media/vc364f3.gif \"vc364f3\")|**MB_ICONEXCLAMATION** and **MB_ICONWARNING**|  \n|![Information &#40;i&#41; icon](../../mfc/reference/media/vc364f4.gif \"vc364f4\")|**MB_ICONASTERISK** and **MB_ICONINFORMATION**|  \n  \n### Example  \n [!code-cpp[NVC_MFCWindowing#104](../../mfc/reference/codesnippet/cpp/cwnd-class_44.cpp)]  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__modifystyle\"></a>  CWnd::ModifyStyle  \n Call this member function to modify a window's style.  \n  \n```  \nBOOL ModifyStyle(\n    DWORD dwRemove,  \n    DWORD dwAdd,  \n    UINT nFlags = 0);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `dwRemove`  \n Specifies window styles to be removed during style modification.  \n  \n `dwAdd`  \n Specifies window styles to be added during style modification.  \n  \n `nFlags`  \n Flags to be passed to [SetWindowPos](#cwnd__setwindowpos), or zero if `SetWindowPos` should not be called. The default is zero. See the Remarks section for a list of preset flags.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Nonzero if style was successfully modified; otherwise, 0.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n Styles to be added or removed can be combined by using the bitwise OR (&#124;) operator. See the topics [Window Styles](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms632600) and [CreateWindow](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms632679) in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../../atl/includes/winsdk_md.md)] for information about the available window styles.  \n  \n If `nFlags` is nonzero, `ModifyStyle` calls the Windows API function [SetWindowPos](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms633545) and redraws the window by combining `nFlags` with the following four preset flags:  \n  \n- `SWP_NOSIZE` Retains the current size.  \n  \n- `SWP_NOMOVE` Retains the current position.  \n  \n- `SWP_NOZORDER` Retains the current Z order.  \n  \n- `SWP_NOACTIVATE` Does not activate the window.  \n  \n To modify a window's extended styles, see [ModifyStyleEx](#cwnd__modifystyleex).  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  For some styles in certain controls (the **ES_READONLY** style in the edit control, for example), **ModifyStyle** may not properly change the style because the control may need to perform special internal processing. In these cases, a corresponding message to change the style will be available ( **EM_SETREADONLY** in the example mentioned).  \n  \n### Example  \n [!code-cpp[NVC_MFCWindowing#105](../../mfc/reference/codesnippet/cpp/cwnd-class_45.cpp)]  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__modifystyleex\"></a>  CWnd::ModifyStyleEx  \n Call this member function to modify a window's extended style.  \n  \n```  \nBOOL ModifyStyleEx(\n    DWORD dwRemove,  \n    DWORD dwAdd,  \n    UINT nFlags = 0);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `dwRemove`  \n Specifies extended styles to be removed during style modification.  \n  \n `dwAdd`  \n Specifies extended styles to be added during style modification.  \n  \n `nFlags`  \n Flags to be passed to [SetWindowPos](#cwnd__setwindowpos), or zero if `SetWindowPos` should not be called. The default is zero. See the Remarks section for a list of preset flags.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Nonzero if style was successfully modified; otherwise, 0.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n Styles to be added or removed can be combined by using the bitwise OR (&#124;) operator. See the topics [Extended Window Styles](../../mfc/reference/extended-window-styles.md) in this book and [CreateWindowEx](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms632680) in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../../atl/includes/winsdk_md.md)] for information about the available extended styles  \n  \n If `nFlags` is nonzero, `ModifyStyleEx` calls the Windows API function [SetWindowPos](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms633545) and redraws the window by combining `nFlags` with the following four preset flags:  \n  \n- `SWP_NOSIZE` Retains the current size.  \n  \n- `SWP_NOMOVE` Retains the current position.  \n  \n- `SWP_NOZORDER` Retains the current Z order.  \n  \n- `SWP_NOACTIVATE` Does not activate the window.  \n  \n To modify windows using regular window styles, see [ModifyStyle](#cwnd__modifystyle).  \n  \n### Example  \n [!code-cpp[NVC_MFCWindowing#106](../../mfc/reference/codesnippet/cpp/cwnd-class_46.cpp)]  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__movewindow\"></a>  CWnd::MoveWindow  \n Changes the position and dimensions.  \n  \n```  \nvoid MoveWindow(\n    int x,  \n    int y,  \n    int nWidth,  \n    int nHeight,  \n    BOOL bRepaint = TRUE);\n\n \nvoid MoveWindow(\n    LPCRECT lpRect,\n    BOOL bRepaint = TRUE);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n *x*  \n Specifies the new position of the left side of the `CWnd`.  \n  \n *y*  \n Specifies the new position of the top of the `CWnd`.  \n  \n `nWidth`  \n Specifies the new width of the `CWnd`.  \n  \n `nHeight`  \n Specifies the new height of the `CWnd`.  \n  \n `bRepaint`  \n Specifies whether `CWnd` is to be repainted. If **TRUE**, `CWnd` receives a [WM_PAINT](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd145213) message in its [OnPaint](#cwnd__onpaint) message handler as usual. If this parameter is **FALSE**, no repainting of any kind occurs. This applies to the client area, to the nonclient area (including the title and scroll bars), and to any part of the parent window uncovered as a result of `CWnd`'s move. When this parameter is **FALSE**, the application must explicitly invalidate or redraw any parts of `CWnd` and parent window that must be redrawn.  \n  \n `lpRect`  \n The [CRect](../../atl-mfc-shared/reference/crect-class.md) object or [RECT structure](../../mfc/reference/rect-structure1.md) that specifies the new size and position.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n For a top-level `CWnd` object, the *x* and *y* parameters are relative to the upper-left corner of the screen. For a child `CWnd` object, they are relative to the upper-left corner of the parent window's client area.  \n  \n The `MoveWindow` function sends the [WM_GETMINMAXINFO](#cwnd__ongetminmaxinfo) message. Handling this message gives `CWnd` the opportunity to modify the default values for the largest and smallest possible windows. If the parameters to the `MoveWindow` member function exceed these values, the values can be replaced by the minimum or maximum values in the `WM_GETMINMAXINFO` handler.  \n  \n### Example  \n  See the example for [CWnd::ClientToScreen](#cwnd__clienttoscreen).  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__notifywinevent\"></a>  CWnd::NotifyWinEvent  \n Signals the system that a predefined event occurred. If any client applications have registered a hook function for the event, the system calls the client's hook function.  \n  \n```  \nvoid NotifyWinEvent(\n    DWORD event,  \n    LONG idObjectType,  \n    LONG idObject);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `event`  \n Specifies the event that occurred. This value must be one of the [event constants](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd318066).  \n  \n *idObjectType*  \n Identifies the kind of object that generated the event. This value is one of the predefined [object identifiers](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd373606) or a custom object ID value.  \n  \n `idObject`  \n Identifies whether the event was generated by an object or a child element of the object. If this value is **CHILDID_SELF**, the event was generated by the object itself. If not, this value is the child ID of the element that generated the event.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n This member function emulates the functionality of the function [NotifyWinEvent](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd373603), as described in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../../atl/includes/winsdk_md.md)].  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__onactivate\"></a>  CWnd::OnActivate  \n The framework calls this member function when a `CWnd` object is being activated or deactivated.  \n  \n```  \nafx_msg void OnActivate(\n    UINT nState,  \n    CWnd* pWndOther,  \n    BOOL bMinimized);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `nState`  \n Specifies whether the `CWnd` is being activated or deactivated. It can be one of the following values:  \n  \n- **WA_INACTIVE** The window is being deactivated.  \n  \n- **WA_ACTIVE** The window is being activated through some method other than a mouse click (for example, by use of the keyboard interface to select the window).  \n  \n- **WA_CLICKACTIVE** The window is being activated by a mouse click.  \n  \n *pWndOther*  \n Pointer to the `CWnd` being activated or deactivated. The pointer can be **NULL**, and it may be temporary.  \n  \n *bMinimized*  \n Specifies the minimized state of the `CWnd` being activated or deactivated. A value of **TRUE** indicates the window is minimized.  \n  \n If **TRUE**, the `CWnd` is being activated; otherwise deactivated.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n If the `CWnd` object is activated with a mouse click, it will also receive an [OnMouseActivate](#cwnd__onmouseactivate) member function call.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  This member function is called by the framework to allow your application to handle a Windows message. The parameters passed to your function reflect the parameters received by the framework when the message was received. If you call the base-class implementation of this function, that implementation will use the parameters originally passed with the message and not the parameters you supply to the function.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__onactivateapp\"></a>  CWnd::OnActivateApp  \n The framework calls this member function to all top-level windows of the task being activated and for all top-level windows of the task being deactivated.  \n  \n```  \nafx_msg void OnActivateApp(\n    BOOL bActive,  \n    DWORD dwThreadID);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `bActive`  \n Specifies whether the `CWnd` is being activated or deactivated. **TRUE** means the `CWnd` is being activated. **FALSE** means the `CWnd` is being deactivated.  \n  \n *dwThreadID*  \n Specifies the value of the thread ID. If `bActive` is **TRUE**, *dwThreadID* identifies the thread that owns the `CWnd` being deactivated. If `bActive` is **FALSE**, *dwThreadID* identifies the thread that owns the `CWnd` being activated.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  This member function is called by the framework to allow your application to handle a Windows message. The parameters passed to your function reflect the parameters received by the framework when the message was received. If you call the base-class implementation of this function, that implementation will use the parameters originally passed with the message and not the parameters you supply to the function.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__onambientproperty\"></a>  CWnd::OnAmbientProperty  \n The framework calls this member function to obtain ambient property values from a window that contains OLE controls.  \n  \n```  \nvirtual BOOL OnAmbientProperty(\n    COleControlSite* pSite,  \n    DISPID dispid,  \n    VARIANT* pvar);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `pSite`  \n Pointer to the site of the control that requested the ambient property.  \n  \n `dispid`  \n The dispatch ID of the requested ambient property.  \n  \n `pvar`  \n Pointer to a caller-allocated `VARIANT` structure, through which the ambient property's value will be returned.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n **TRUE** if the ambient property is supported; **FALSE** if not.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n Override this function to alter the default ambient property values returned by an OLE control container to its controls. Any ambient property requests not handled by an overriding function should be forwarded to the base class implementation.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__onappcommand\"></a>  CWnd::OnAppCommand  \n The framework calls this member function when the user generates an application command event. Such an event occurs when the user clicks an application command button or types an application command key.  \n  \n```  \nafx_msg void OnAppCommand(\n    CWnd* pWnd,  \n    UINT nCmd,  \n    UINT nDevice,  \n    UINT nKey);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n  \n|Parameter|Description|  \n|---------------|-----------------|  \n|[in] `pWnd`|Pointer to a [CWnd](../../mfc/reference/cwnd-class.md) object that represents the window where the user clicked the comman button or pressed the command key. This window can be a child window of the window receiving the message.|  \n|[in] `nCmd`|Indicates the application command. For a list of possible values, see the commands under the *cmd* section of the `lParam` parameter of [WM_APPCOMMAND](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms646275).|  \n|[in] `nDevice`|The input device that generated the input event. For a list of possible values, see the devices under the *uDevice* section of the `lParam` parameter of [WM_APPCOMMAND](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms646275).|  \n|[in] `nKey`|Indicates any virtual keys that are down, such as the CTRL key or the left mouse button. For a list of possible values, see the keys under the *dwKeys* section of the `lParam` parameter of [WM_APPCOMMAND](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms646275). For more information, see the \"Message Parameters\" subheading in [About Mouse Input](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms645601).|  \n  \n### Remarks  \n This method receives the [WM_APPCOMMAND](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms646275) notification, which is described in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../../atl/includes/winsdk_md.md)].  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  This member function is called by the framework to allow your application to handle a Windows message. The parameters passed to your function reflect the parameters received by the framework when the message was received. If you call the base-class implementation of this function, that implementation will use the parameters originally passed with the message and not the parameters you supply to the function.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__onaskcbformatname\"></a>  CWnd::OnAskCbFormatName  \n The framework calls this member function when the Clipboard contains a data handle for the `CF_OWNERDISPLAY` format (that is, when the Clipboard owner will display the Clipboard contents).  \n  \n```  \nafx_msg void OnAskCbFormatName(\n    UINT nMaxCount,  \n    LPTSTR lpszString);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `nMaxCount`  \n Specifies the maximum number of bytes to copy.  \n  \n `lpszString`  \n Points to the buffer where the copy of the format name is to be stored.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The Clipboard owner should provide a name for its format.  \n  \n Override this member function and copy the name of the `CF_OWNERDISPLAY` format into the specified buffer, not exceeding the maximum number of bytes specified.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  This member function is called by the framework to allow your application to handle a Windows message.

This gives the `CWnd` the opportunity to cancel modes such as mouse capture.  \n  \n The default implementation responds by calling the [ReleaseCapture](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms646261) Windows function. Override this member function in your derived class to handle other modes.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__oncapturechanged\"></a>  CWnd::OnCaptureChanged  \n The framework calls this member function to notify the window that is losing the mouse capture.  \n  \n```  \nafx_msg void OnCaptureChanged(CWnd* pWnd);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `pWnd`  \n A pointer to the window to gain mouse capture  \n  \n### Remarks  \n A window receives this message even if it calls [ReleaseCapture](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms646261) itself. An application should not attempt to set the mouse capture in response to this message. When it receives this message, a window should redraw itself, if necessary, to reflect the new mouse-capture state.  \n  \n See the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../../atl/includes/winsdk_md.md)] for information on the `ReleaseCapture` Windows function.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  This member function is called by the framework to allow your application to handle a Windows message. The parameters passed to your function reflect the parameters received by the framework when the message was received. If you call the base-class implementation of this function, that implementation will use the parameters originally passed with the message and not the parameters you supply to the function.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__onchangecbchain\"></a>  CWnd::OnChangeCbChain  \n The framework calls this member function for each window in the Clipboard-viewer chain to notify it that a window is being removed from the chain.  \n  \n```  \nafx_msg void OnChangeCbChain(\n    HWND hWndRemove,  \n    HWND hWndAfter);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `hWndRemove`  \n Specifies the window handle that is being removed from the Clipboard-viewer chain.  \n  \n `hWndAfter`  \n Specifies the window handle that follows the window being removed from the Clipboard-viewer chain.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n Each `CWnd` object that receives an `OnChangeCbChain` call should use the [SendMessage](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms644950) Windows function to send the [WM_CHANGECBCHAIN](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms649019) message to the next window in the Clipboard-viewer chain (the handle returned by `SetClipboardViewer`). If `hWndRemove` is the next window in the chain, the window specified by `hWndAfter` becomes the next window, and Clipboard messages are passed on to it.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  This member function is called by the framework to allow your application to handle a Windows message. The parameters passed to your function reflect the parameters received by the framework when the message was received. If you call the base-class implementation of this function, that implementation will use the parameters originally passed with the message and not the parameters you supply to the function.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__onchangeuistate\"></a>  CWnd::OnChangeUIState  \n Called when the user interface (UI) state should be changed.  \n  \n```  \nafx_msg void OnChangeUIState(\n    UINT nAction,  \n    UINT nUIElement);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `nAction`  \n Specifies the action to be taken. Can be one of the following values:  \n  \n- **UIS_CLEAR** The UI state element (specified by `nUIElement`) should be hidden.  \n  \n- **UIS_INITIALIZE** The UI state element (specified by `nUIElement`) should be changed based on the last input event. For more information, see the **Remarks** section of [WM_CHANGEUISTATE](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms646342).  \n  \n- **UIS_SET** The UI state element (specified by `nUIElement`) should be visible.  \n  \n `nUIElement`  \n Specifies which UI state elements are affected or the style of the control. Can be one of the following values:  \n  \n- **UISF_HIDEACCEL** Keyboard accelerators.  \n  \n- **UISF_HIDEFOCUS** Focus indicators.  \n  \n- **UISF_ACTIVE Windows XP:** A control should be drawn in the style used for active controls.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n This member function emulates the functionality of the [WM_CHANGEUISTATE](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms646342) message, as described in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../../atl/includes/winsdk_md.md)].  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__onchar\"></a>  CWnd::OnChar  \n The framework calls this member function when a keystroke translates to a nonsystem character.  \n  \n```  \nafx_msg void OnChar(\n    UINT nChar,  \n    UINT nRepCnt,  \n    UINT nFlags);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `nChar`  \n Contains the character code value of the key.  \n  \n `nRepCnt`  \n Contains the repeat count, the number of times the keystroke is repeated when user holds down the key.  \n  \n `nFlags`  \n Contains the scan code, key-transition code, previous key state, and context code, as shown in the following list:  \n  \n|Value|Meaning|  \n|-----------|-------------|  \n|0-15|Specifies the repeat count. The value is the number of times the keystroke is repeated as a result of the user holding down the key.|  \n|16-23|Specifies the scan code. The value depends on the original equipment manufacturer (OEM)|  \n|24|Specifies whether the key is an extended key, such as the right-hand ALT and CTRL keys that appear on an enhanced 101- or 102-key keyboard. The value is 1 if it is an extended key; otherwise, it is 0.|  \n|25-28|Used internally by Windows.|  \n|29|Specifies the context code. The value is 1 if the ALT key is held down while the key is pressed; otherwise, the value is 0.|  \n|30|Specifies the previous key state. The value is 1 if the key is down before the message is sent, or it is 0 if the key is up.|  \n|31|Specifies the transition state. The value is 1 if the key is being released, or it is 0 if the key is being pressed.|  \n  \n### Remarks  \n This function is called before the [OnKeyUp](#cwnd__onkeyup) member function and after the [OnKeyDown](#cwnd__onkeydown) member function are called. `OnChar` contains the value of the keyboard key being pressed or released.  \n  \n Because there is not necessarily a one-to-one correspondence between keys pressed and `OnChar` calls generated, the information in `nFlags` is generally not useful to applications. The information in `nFlags` applies only to the most recent call to the `OnKeyUp` member function or the `OnKeyDown` member function that precedes the call to `OnChar`.  \n  \n For IBM Enhanced 101- and 102-key keyboards, enhanced keys are the right ALT and the right CTRL keys on the main section of the keyboard; the INS, DEL, HOME, END, PAGE UP, PAGE DOWN, and arrow keys in the clusters to the left of the numeric keypad; and the slash (/) and ENTER keys in the numeric keypad. Some other keyboards may support the extended-key bit in `nFlags`.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  This member function is called by the framework to allow your application to handle a Windows message. The parameters passed to your function reflect the parameters received by the framework when the message was received. If you call the base-class implementation of this function, that implementation will use the parameters originally passed with the message and not the parameters you supply to the function.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__onchartoitem\"></a>  CWnd::OnCharToItem  \n Called when a list box with the [LBS_WANTKEYBOARDINPUT](../../mfc/reference/list-box-styles.md) style sends its owner a [WM_CHARTOITEM](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb761358) message in response to a [WM_CHAR](#cwnd__onchar) message.  \n  \n```  \nafx_msg int OnCharToItem(\n    UINT nChar,  \n    CListBox* pListBox,  \n    UINT nIndex);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `nChar`  \n Specifies the value of the key pressed by the user.  \n  \n `pListBox`  \n Specifies a pointer to the list box. It may be temporary.  \n  \n `nIndex`  \n Specifies the current caret position.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n The framework calls this member function to specify the action that the application performed in response to the call. A return value of –2 indicates that the application handled all aspects of selecting the item and wants no further action by the list box. A return value of –1 indicates that the list box should perform the default action in response to the keystroke. A return value of 0 or greater specifies the zero-based index of an item in the list box and indicates that the list box should perform the default action for the keystroke on the given item.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  This member function is called by the framework to allow your application to handle a Windows message. The parameters passed to your function reflect the parameters received by the framework when the message was received. If you call the base-class implementation of this function, that implementation will use the parameters originally passed with the message and not the parameters you supply to the function.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__onchildactivate\"></a>  CWnd::OnChildActivate  \n If the `CWnd` object is a multiple document interface (MDI) child window, `OnChildActivate` is called by the framework when the user clicks the window's title bar or when the window is activated, moved, or sized.  \n  \n```  \nafx_msg void OnChildActivate();\n```  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__onchildnotify\"></a>  CWnd::OnChildNotify  \n This member function is called by this window's parent window when it receives a notification message that applies to this window.  \n  \n```  \nvirtual BOOL OnChildNotify(\n    UINT message,  \n    WPARAM wParam,  \n    LPARAM lParam,  \n    LRESULT* pResult);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `message`  \n A Windows message number sent to a parent window.  \n  \n `wParam`  \n The **wparam** associated with the message.  \n  \n `lParam`  \n The **lparam** associated with the message.  \n  \n `pLResult`  \n A pointer to a value to be returned from the parent's window procedure. This pointer will be **NULL** if no return value is expected.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Nonzero if this window is responsible for handling the message sent to its parent; otherwise 0.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n Never call this member function directly.  \n  \n The default implementation of this member function returns 0, which means that the parent should handle the message.  \n  \n Override this member function to extend the manner in which a control responds to notification messages.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__onclipboardupdate\"></a>  CWnd::OnClipboardUpdate  \n The framework calls this member function when the contents of the clipboard have changed.  \n  \n```  \nafx_msg void OnClipboardUpdate();\n```  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__onclose\"></a>  CWnd::OnClose  \n The framework calls this member function as a signal that the `CWnd` or an application is to terminate.  \n  \n```  \nafx_msg void OnClose();\n```  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The default implementation calls `DestroyWindow`.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__oncolorizationcolorchanged\"></a>  CWnd::OnColorizationColorChanged  \n The framework calls this member when the rendering policy for the nonclient area has changed.  \n  \n```  \nafx_msg void OnColorizationColorChanged(\n    DWORD dwColorizationColor,   \n    BOOL bOpacity);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n  \n|Parameter|Description|  \n|---------------|-----------------|  \n|[in] `dwColorizationColor`|Specifies the new colorization color.<br /><br /> The color format is a hexadecimal number of the form 0xAARRGGBB, where each of the four components ranges from 0x00 through 0xFF. The AA component is the alpha value, RR is the color red, GG is green, and BB is blue.|  \n|[in] `bOpacity`|`true` if the new color is blended with opacity; `false` if it is not.|  \n  \n### Remarks  \n This method receives the [WM_DWMNCRENDERINGCHANGED](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd388198) notification message, which is described in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../../atl/includes/winsdk_md.md)].  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  This member function is called by the framework to allow your application to handle a Windows message. The parameters passed to your function reflect the parameters received by the framework when the message was received. If you call the base-class implementation of this function, that implementation will use the parameters originally passed with the message and not the parameters you supply to the function.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__oncommand\"></a>  CWnd::OnCommand  \n The framework calls this member function when the user selects an item from a menu, when a child control sends a notification message, or when an accelerator keystroke is translated.  \n  \n```  \nvirtual BOOL OnCommand(\n    WPARAM wParam,  \n    LPARAM lParam);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `wParam`  \n The low-order word of `wParam` identifies the command ID of the menu item, control, or accelerator. The high-order word of `wParam` specifies the notification message if the message is from a control. If the message is from an accelerator, the high-order word is 1. If the message is from a menu, the high-order word is 0.  \n  \n `lParam`  \n Identifies the control that sends the message if the message is from a control. Otherwise, `lParam` is 0.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n An application returns nonzero if it processes this message; otherwise 0.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n `OnCommand` processes the message map for control notification and `ON_COMMAND` entries, and calls the appropriate member function.  \n  \n Override this member function in your derived class to handle the [WM_COMMAND](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms647591) message. An override will not process the message map unless the base class `OnCommand` is called.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  This member function is called by the framework to allow your application to handle a Windows message. The parameters passed to your function reflect the parameters received by the framework when the message was received. If you call the base-class implementation of this function, that implementation will use the parameters originally passed with the message and not the parameters you supply to the function.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__oncompacting\"></a>  CWnd::OnCompacting  \n The framework calls this member function for all top-level windows when Windows detects that more than 12.5 percent of system time over a 30- to 60-second interval is being spent compacting memory.  \n  \n```  \nafx_msg void OnCompacting(UINT nCpuTime);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n *nCpuTime*  \n Specifies the ratio of CPU time currently spent by Windows compacting memory to CPU time spent performing other operations. For example, 8000h represents 50 percent of CPU time spent compacting memory.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n This indicates that system memory is low.  \n  \n When a `CWnd` object receives this call, it should free as much memory as possible, taking into account the current level of activity of the application and the total number of applications running in Windows. The application can call the Windows function to determine how many applications are running.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  This member function is called by the framework to allow your application to handle a Windows message. The parameters passed to your function reflect the parameters received by the framework when the message was received. If you call the base-class implementation of this function, that implementation will use the parameters originally passed with the message and not the parameters you supply to the function.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__oncompareitem\"></a>  CWnd::OnCompareItem  \n The framework calls this member function to specify the relative position of a new item in a child sorted owner-draw combo or list box.  \n  \n```  \nafx_msg int OnCompareItem(\n    int nIDCtl,  \n    LPCOMPAREITEMSTRUCT lpCompareItemStruct);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `nIDCtl`  \n The identifier of the control that sent the `WM_COMPAREITEM` message.  \n  \n `lpCompareItemStruct`  \n Contains a long pointer to a [COMPAREITEMSTRUCT](../../mfc/reference/compareitemstruct-structure.md) data structure that contains the identifiers and application-supplied data for two items in the combo or list box.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Indicates the relative position of the two items. It may be any of the following values:  \n  \n|Value|Meaning|  \n|-----------|-------------|  \n|–1|Item 1 sorts before item 2.|  \n|0|Item 1 and item 2 sort the same.|  \n|1|Item 1 sorts after item 2.|  \n  \n### Remarks  \n If a combo or list box is created with the [CBS_SORT](../../mfc/reference/combo-box-styles.md) or [LBS_SORT](../../mfc/reference/list-box-styles.md) style, Windows sends the combo-box or list-box owner a `WM_COMPAREITEM` message whenever the application adds a new item.  \n  \n Two items in the combo or list box are reformed in a `COMPAREITEMSTRUCT` structure pointed to by `lpCompareItemStruct`. `OnCompareItem` should return a value that indicates which of the items should appear before the other. Typically, Windows makes this call several times until it determines the exact position for the new item.  \n  \n If the **hwndItem** member of the `COMPAREITEMSTRUCT` structure belongs to a [CListBox](../../mfc/reference/clistbox-class.md) or [CComboBox](../../mfc/reference/ccombobox-class.md) object, then the `CompareItem` virtual function of the appropriate class is called. Override `CComboBox::CompareItem` or `CListBox::CompareItem` in your derived `CListBox` or `CComboBox` class to do the item comparison.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  This member function is called by the framework to allow your application to handle a Windows message.

The parameters passed to your function reflect the parameters received by the framework when the message was received. If you call the base-class implementation of this function, that implementation will use the parameters originally passed with the message and not the parameters you supply to the function.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__oncontextmenu\"></a>  CWnd::OnContextMenu  \n Called by the framework when the user has clicked the right mouse button (right clicked) in the window.  \n  \n```  \nafx_msg void OnContextMenu(\n    CWnd* pWnd,  \n    CPoint pos);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `pWnd`  \n Handle to the window in which the user right clicked the mouse. This can be a child window of the window receiving the message. For more information about processing this message, see the Remarks section.  \n  \n `pos`  \n Position of the cursor, in screen coordinates, at the time of the mouse click.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n You can process this message by displaying a context menu using the [TrackPopupMenu](../../mfc/reference/cmenu-class.md#cmenu__trackpopupmenu).  \n  \n If you do not display a context menu you should pass this message onto the [DefWindowProc](#cwnd__defwindowproc) function. If your window is a child window, `DefWindowProc` sends the message to the parent. Otherwise, `DefWindowProc` displays a default context menu if the specified position is in the window's caption.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__oncopydata\"></a>  CWnd::OnCopyData  \n This member function is called by the framework to copy data from one application to another.  \n  \n```  \nafx_msg BOOL OnCopyData(\n    CWnd* pWnd,  \n    COPYDATASTRUCT* pCopyDataStruct);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `pWnd`  \n A pointer to a [CWnd](../../mfc/reference/cwnd-class.md) object that is sending the data.  \n  \n `pCopyDataStruct`  \n A pointer to a [COPYDATASTRUCT](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms649010) structure that contains the data being sent.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Returns **TRUE** if the receiving application successfully accepts the data. Otherwise, returns **FALSE**.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The data being passed must not contain pointers or other references to objects not accessible to the application receiving the data.  \n  \n While the data is being copied, it must not be changed by another thread of the sending process.  \n  \n The receiving application should consider the data read-only. The structure pointed to by the parameter `pCopyDataStruct` is valid only during the transfer of data; however, the receiving application should not free the memory associated with the structure.  \n  \n If the receiving application needs access to the data after this function returns, it must copy the data received to a local buffer.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  This member function is called by the framework to allow your application to handle a Windows message. The parameters passed to your function reflect the parameters received by the framework when the message was received. If you call the base-class implementation of this function, that implementation will use the parameters originally passed with the message and not the parameters you supply to the function.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__oncreate\"></a>  CWnd::OnCreate  \n The framework calls this member function when an application requests that the Windows window be created by calling the [Create](#cwnd__create) or [CreateEx](#cwnd__createex) member function.  \n  \n```  \nafx_msg int OnCreate(LPCREATESTRUCT lpCreateStruct);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `lpCreateStruct`  \n Points to a [CREATESTRUCT](../../mfc/reference/createstruct-structure.md) structure that contains information about the `CWnd` object being created.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n `OnCreate` must return 0 to continue the creation of the `CWnd` object. If the application returns –1, the window will be destroyed.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The `CWnd` object receives this call after the window is created but before it becomes visible. `OnCreate` is called before the **Create** or `CreateEx` member function returns.  \n  \n Override this member function to perform any needed initialization of a derived class.  \n  \n The `CREATESTRUCT` structure contains copies of the parameters used to create the window.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  This member function is called by the framework to allow your application to handle a Windows message. The parameters passed to your function reflect the parameters received by the framework when the message was received. If you call the base-class implementation of this function, that implementation will use the parameters originally passed with the message and not the parameters you supply to the function.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__onctlcolor\"></a>  CWnd::OnCtlColor  \n The framework calls this member function when a child control is about to be drawn.  \n  \n```  \nafx_msg HBRUSH OnCtlColor(\n    CDC* pDC,  \n    CWnd* pWnd,  \n    UINT nCtlColor);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `pDC`  \n Contains a pointer to the display context for the child window. May be temporary.  \n  \n `pWnd`  \n Contains a pointer to the control asking for the color. May be temporary.  \n  \n `nCtlColor`  \n Contains one of the following values, specifying the type of control:  \n  \n- **CTLCOLOR_BTN** Button control  \n  \n- **CTLCOLOR_DLG** Dialog box  \n  \n- **CTLCOLOR_EDIT** Edit control  \n  \n- **CTLCOLOR_LISTBOX** List-box control  \n  \n- **CTLCOLOR_MSGBOX** Message box  \n  \n- **CTLCOLOR_SCROLLBAR** Scroll-bar control  \n  \n- **CTLCOLOR_STATIC** Static control  \n  \n### Return Value  \n `OnCtlColor` must return a handle to the brush that is to be used for painting the control background.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n Most controls send this message to their parent (usually a dialog box) to prepare the `pDC` for drawing the control using the correct colors.  \n  \n To change the text color, call the `SetTextColor` member function with the desired red, green, and blue (RGB) values.  \n  \n To change the background color of a single-line edit control, set the brush handle in both the **CTLCOLOR_EDIT** and **CTLCOLOR_MSGBOX** message codes, and call the [CDC::SetBkColor](../../mfc/reference/cdc-class.md#cdc__setbkcolor) function in response to the **CTLCOLOR_EDIT** code.  \n  \n `OnCtlColor` will not be called for the list box of a drop-down combo box because the drop-down list box is actually a child of the combo box and not a child of the window. To change the color of the drop-down list box, create a `CComboBox` with an override of `OnCtlColor` that checks for **CTLCOLOR_LISTBOX** in the `nCtlColor` parameter. In this handler, the `SetBkColor` member function must be used to set the background color for the text.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  This member function is called by the framework to allow your application to handle a Windows message. The parameters passed to your function reflect the parameters received by the framework when the message was received. If you call the base-class implementation of this function, that implementation will use the parameters originally passed with the message and not the parameters you supply to the function. To add the following method to your dialog class, use the Visual Studio properties pane to add a message handler for WM_CTLCOLOR. Alternatively, you can manually add an ON_WM_CTLCOLOR() entry to the message map.  \n  \n### Example  \n [!code-cpp[NVC_MFCWindowing#107](../../mfc/reference/codesnippet/cpp/cwnd-class_47.cpp)]  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__ondeadchar\"></a>  CWnd::OnDeadChar  \n The framework calls this member function when the [OnKeyUp](#cwnd__onkeyup) member function and the [OnKeyDown](#cwnd__onkeydown) member functions are called.  \n  \n```  \nafx_msg void OnDeadChar(\n    UINT nChar,  \n    UINT nRepCnt,  \n    UINT nFlags);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `nChar`  \n Specifies the dead-key character value.  \n  \n `nRepCnt`  \n Specifies the repeat count.  \n  \n `nFlags`  \n Specifies the scan code, key-transition code, previous key state, and context code, as shown in the following list:  \n  \n|Value|Description|  \n|-----------|-----------------|  \n|0–7|Scan code (OEM-dependent value). Low byte of high-order word.|  \n|8|Extended key, such as a function key or a key on the numeric keypad (1 if it is an extended key; otherwise 0).|  \n|9–10|Not used.|  \n|11–12|Used internally by Windows.|  \n|13|Context code (1 if the ALT key is held down while the key is pressed; otherwise 0).|  \n|14|Previous key state (1 if the key is down before the call, 0 if the key is up).|  \n|15|Transition state (1 if the key is being released, 0 if the key is being pressed).|  \n  \n### Remarks  \n This member function can be used to specify the character value of a dead key. A dead key is a key, such as the umlaut (double-dot) character, that is combined with other characters to form a composite character. For example, the umlaut-O character consists of the dead key, umlaut, and the O key.  \n  \n An application typically uses `OnDeadChar` to give the user feedback about each key pressed. For example, an application can display the accent in the current character position without moving the caret.  \n  \n Since there is not necessarily a one-to-one correspondence between keys pressed and `OnDeadChar` calls, the information in `nFlags` is generally not useful to applications. The information in `nFlags` applies only to the most recent call to the [OnKeyUp](#cwnd__onkeyup) member function or the [OnKeyDown](#cwnd__onkeydown) member function that precedes the `OnDeadChar` call.  \n  \n For IBM Enhanced 101- and 102-key keyboards, enhanced keys are the right ALT and the right CTRL keys on the main section of the keyboard; the INS, DEL, HOME, END, PAGE UP, PAGE DOWN, and arrow keys in the clusters to the left of the numeric keypad; and the slash (/) and ENTER keys in the numeric keypad. Some other keyboards may support the extended-key bit in `nFlags`.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  This member function is called by the framework to allow your application to handle a Windows message.

Override the `DeleteItem` member function of the appropriate control's class to delete item-specific data.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  This member function is called by the framework to allow your application to handle a Windows message. The parameters passed to your function reflect the parameters received by the framework when the message was received. If you call the base-class implementation of this function, that implementation will use the parameters originally passed with the message and not the parameters you supply to the function.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__ondestroy\"></a>  CWnd::OnDestroy  \n The framework calls this member function to inform the `CWnd` object that it is being destroyed.  \n  \n```  \nafx_msg void OnDestroy();\n```  \n  \n### Remarks  \n `OnDestroy` is called after the `CWnd` object is removed from the screen.  \n  \n `OnDestroy` is called first for the `CWnd` being destroyed, then for the child windows of `CWnd` as they are destroyed. It can be assumed that all child windows still exist while `OnDestroy` runs.  \n  \n If the `CWnd` object being destroyed is part of the Clipboard-viewer chain (set by calling the [SetClipboardViewer](#cwnd__setclipboardviewer) member function), the `CWnd` must remove itself from the Clipboard-viewer chain by calling the [ChangeClipboardChain](#cwnd__changeclipboardchain) member function before returning from the `OnDestroy` function.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__ondestroyclipboard\"></a>  CWnd::OnDestroyClipboard  \n The framework calls this member function for the Clipboard owner when the Clipboard is emptied through a call to the [EmptyClipboard](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms649037) Windows function.  \n  \n```  \nafx_msg void OnDestroyClipboard();\n```  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__ondevicechange\"></a>  CWnd::OnDeviceChange  \n The framework calls this member function to notify an application or device driver of a change to the hardware configuration of a device or the computer.  \n  \n```  \nafx_msg BOOL OnDeviceChange(\n    UINT nEventType,  \n    DWORD_PTR dwData);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n *nEventType*  \n An event type. See the Remarks section for a description of the available values  \n  \n `dwData`  \n The address of a structure that contains event-specific data. Its meaning depends on the given event.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n For devices that offer software-controllable features, such as ejection and locking, the operating system typically sends a **DBT_DEVICEREMOVEPENDING** message to let applications and device drivers end their use of the device gracefully.  \n  \n If the operating system forcefully removes of a device, it may not send a **DBT_DEVICEQUERYREMOVE** message before doing so.  \n  \n The *nEvent* parameter can be one of these values:  \n  \n- [DBT_DEVICEARRIVAL](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa363205) A device has been inserted and is now available.  \n  \n- [DBT_DEVICEQUERYREMOVE](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa363206) Permission to remove a device is requested. Any application can deny this request and cancel the removal.  \n  \n- [DBT_DEVICEQUERYREMOVEFAILED](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa363207) Request to remove a device has been canceled.  \n  \n- [DBT_DEVICEREMOVEPENDING](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa363209) Device is about to be removed. Cannot be denied.  \n  \n- [DBT_DEVICEREMOVECOMPLETE](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa363208) Device has been removed.  \n  \n- [DBT_DEVICETYPESPECIFIC](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa363210) Device-specific event.  \n  \n- [DBT_CONFIGCHANGED](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa363203) Current configuration has changed.  \n  \n- **DBT_DEVNODES_CHANGED** Device node has changed.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  This member function is called by the framework to allow your application to handle a Windows message.

Applications that use the Windows **ExtDeviceMode** function to save and restore device settings typically do not process this function.  \n  \n This function is not called when the user changes the default printer from Control Panel. In this case, the `OnWinIniChange` function is called.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  This member function is called by the framework to allow your application to handle a Windows message.

The handle of the next window is returned by the [SetClipboardViewer](#cwnd__setclipboardviewer) member function; it may be modified in response to an [OnChangeCbChain](#cwnd__onchangecbchain) member function call.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__ondrawiconicthumbnailorlivepreview\"></a>  CWnd::OnDrawIconicThumbnailOrLivePreview  \n Called by the framework when it needs to obtain a bitmap to be displayed on Windows 7 tab thumbnail, or on the client for application peek.  \n  \n```  \nvirtual void OnDrawIconicThumbnailOrLivePreview(\n    CDC& dc,  \n    CRect rect,  \n    CSize szRequiredThumbnailSize,  \n    BOOL bIsThumbnail,  \n    BOOL& bAlphaChannelSet);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `dc`  \n Specifies the device context.  \n  \n `rect`  \n Specifies the bounding rectangle of the area to render.  \n  \n `szRequiredThumbnailSize`  \n Specifies the size of the target thumbnail. Should be ignored if `bIsThumbnail` is `FALSE`.  \n  \n `bIsThumbnail`  \n Specifies whether this method is called for iconic thumbnail or live preview (peek).  \n  \n `bAlphaChannelSet`  \n [out] Set it to `TRUE` if your implementation initializes the alpha channel of a bitmap selected in `dc`.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n Override this method in a derived class and draw on the specified device context in order to customize thumbnail and peek. If `bThumbnail` is `TRUE`, `szRequiredThumbnailSize` can be ignored. In this case you should be aware that you draw full sized bitmap (that is, a bitmap that covers the whole client area). The device context ( `dc`) comes with selected 32 bits bitmap. The default implementation sends WM_PRINT to this window with PRF_CLIENT, PRF_CHILDREN, and PRF_NONCLIENT flags.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__ondrawitem\"></a>  CWnd::OnDrawItem  \n The framework calls this member function for the owner of an owner-draw button control, combo-box control, list-box control, or menu when a visual aspect of the control or menu has changed.  \n  \n```  \nafx_msg void OnDrawItem(\n    int nIDCtl,  \n    LPDRAWITEMSTRUCT lpDrawItemStruct);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `nIDCtl`  \n Contains the identifier of the control that sent the `WM_DRAWITEM` message. If a menu sent the message, `nIDCtl` contains 0.  \n  \n `lpDrawItemStruct`  \n Specifies a long pointer to a `DRAWITEMSTRUCT` data structure that contains information about the item to be drawn and the type of drawing required.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The **itemAction** member of the [DRAWITEMSTRUCT](../../mfc/reference/drawitemstruct-structure.md) structure defines the drawing operation that is to be performed. The data in this member allows the owner of the control to determine what drawing action is required.  \n  \n Before returning from processing this message, an application should ensure that the device context identified by the `hDC` member of the `DRAWITEMSTRUCT` structure is restored to the default state.  \n  \n If the **hwndItem** member belongs to a [CButton](../../mfc/reference/cbutton-class.md), [CMenu](../../mfc/reference/cmenu-class.md), [CListBox](../../mfc/reference/clistbox-class.md), or [CComboBox](../../mfc/reference/ccombobox-class.md) object, then the `DrawItem` virtual function of the appropriate class is called. Override the `DrawItem` member function of the appropriate control's class to draw the item.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  This member function is called by the framework to allow your application to handle a Windows message.

If you call the base-class implementation of this function, that implementation will use the parameters originally passed with the message and not the parameters you supply to the function.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__ondropfiles\"></a>  CWnd::OnDropFiles  \n The framework calls this member function when the user releases the left mouse button over a window that has registered itself as the recipient of dropped files.  \n  \n```  \nafx_msg void OnDropFiles(HDROP hDropInfo);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n *hDropInfo*  \n A pointer to an internal data structure that describes the dropped files. This handle is used by the **DragFinish**, **DragQueryFile**, and **DragQueryPoint** Windows functions to retrieve information about the dropped files.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n Typically, a derived class will be designed to support dropped files and it will register itself during window construction.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  This member function is called by the framework to allow your application to handle a Windows message. The parameters passed to your function reflect the parameters received by the framework when the message was received. If you call the base-class implementation of this function, that implementation will use the parameters originally passed with the message and not the parameters you supply to the function.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__onenable\"></a>  CWnd::OnEnable  \n The framework calls this member function when an application changes the enabled state of the `CWnd` object.  \n  \n```  \nafx_msg void OnEnable(BOOL bEnable);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `bEnable`  \n Specifies whether the `CWnd` object has been enabled or disabled. This parameter is **TRUE** if the `CWnd` has been enabled; it is **FALSE** if the `CWnd` has been disabled.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n `OnEnable` is called before the [EnableWindow](#cwnd__enablewindow) member function returns, but after the window enabled state ( [WS_DISABLED](../../mfc/reference/window-styles.md) style bit) has changed.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  This member function is called by the framework to allow your application to handle a Windows message. The parameters passed to your function reflect the parameters received by the framework when the message was received.

It is **TRUE** if the session is being ended; otherwise **FALSE**.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The `OnEndSession` call informs the `CWnd` object whether the session is actually ending.  \n  \n If `bEnding` is **TRUE**, Windows can terminate any time after all applications have returned from processing this call. Consequently, have an application perform all tasks required for termination within `OnEndSession`.  \n  \n You do not need to call the [DestroyWindow](#cwnd__destroywindow) member function or [PostQuitMessage](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms644945) Windows function when the session is ending.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  This member function is called by the framework to allow your application to handle a Windows message.

This parameter can be one of the following values:  \n  \n- **MSGF_DIALOGBOX** The system is idle because a dialog box is being displayed.  \n  \n- **MSGF_MENU** The system is idle because a menu is being displayed.  \n  \n *pWho*  \n Specifies a pointer to the dialog box (if `nWhy` is **MSGF_DIALOGBOX**), or the window that contains the displayed menu (if `nWhy` is **MSGF_MENU**). This pointer may be temporary and should not be stored for later use.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n A modal dialog box or menu enters an idle state when no messages are waiting in its queue after it has processed one or more previous messages.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  This member function is called by the framework to allow your application to handle a Windows message.

The parameters passed to your function reflect the parameters received by the framework when the message was received. If you call the base-class implementation of this function, that implementation will use the parameters originally passed with the message and not the parameters you supply to the function.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__onerasebkgnd\"></a>  CWnd::OnEraseBkgnd  \n The framework calls this member function when the `CWnd` object background needs erasing (for example, when resized).  \n  \n```  \nafx_msg BOOL OnEraseBkgnd(CDC* pDC);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `pDC`  \n Specifies the device-context object.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Nonzero if it erases the background; otherwise 0.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n It is called to prepare an invalidated region for painting.  \n  \n The default implementation erases the background using the window class background brush specified by the **hbrBackground** member of the window class structure.  \n  \n If the **hbrBackground** member is **NULL**, your overridden version of `OnEraseBkgnd` should erase the background color. Your version should also align the origin of the intended brush with the `CWnd` coordinates by first calling [UnrealizeObject](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd145164) for the brush, and then selecting the brush.  \n  \n An overridden `OnEraseBkgnd` should return nonzero in response to `WM_ERASEBKGND` if it processes the message and erases the background; this indicates that no further erasing is required. If it returns 0, the window will remain marked as needing to be erased. (Typically, this means that the **fErase** member of the `PAINTSTRUCT` structure will be **TRUE**.)  \n  \n Windows assumes the background is computed with the `MM_TEXT` mapping mode. If the device context is using any other mapping mode, the area erased may not be within the visible part of the client area.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  This member function is called by the framework to allow your application to handle a Windows message.

(An application can use this flag with **DLGC_BUTTON** to indicate that it processes button input but relies on the system for default pushbutton processing.)  \n  \n- **DLGC_RADIOBUTTON** Radio button.  \n  \n- **DLGC_STATIC** Static control.  \n  \n- **DLGC_WANTALLKEYS** All keyboard input.  \n  \n- **DLGC_WANTARROWS** Arrow keys.  \n  \n- **DLGC_WANTCHARS** `WM_CHAR` messages.  \n  \n- **DLGC_WANTMESSAGE** All keyboard input. The application passes this message on to the control.  \n  \n- **DLGC_WANTTAB** TAB key.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n Normally, Windows handles all arrow-key and TAB-key input to a `CWnd` control. By overriding `OnGetDlgCode`, a `CWnd` control can choose a particular type of input to process itself.  \n  \n The default `OnGetDlgCode` functions for the predefined control classes return a code appropriate for each class.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__ongetminmaxinfo\"></a>  CWnd::OnGetMinMaxInfo  \n The framework calls this member function whenever Windows needs to know the maximized position or dimensions, or the minimum or maximum tracking size.  \n  \n```  \nafx_msg void OnGetMinMaxInfo(MINMAXINFO* lpMMI);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n *lpMMI*  \n Points to a `MINMAXINFO` structure that contains information about a window's maximized size and position and its minimum and maximum tracking size. For more about this structure, see the [MINMAXINFO](../../mfc/reference/minmaxinfo-structure.md) structure.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The maximized size is the size of the window when its borders are fully extended. The maximum tracking size of the window is the largest window size that can be achieved by using the borders to size the window. The minimum tracking size of the window is the smallest window size that can be achieved by using the borders to size the window.  \n  \n Windows fills in an array of points specifying default values for the various positions and dimensions. The application may change these values in `OnGetMinMaxInfo`.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  This member function is called by the framework to allow your application to handle a Windows message.

This is the default for all Microsoft Foundation Class windows. Windows generates an `OnMButtonDblClk` call when the user presses, releases, and then presses the middle mouse button again within the system's double-click time limit. Double-clicking the middle mouse button actually generates four events: [WM_MBUTTONDOWN](#cwnd__onmbuttondown) and [WM_MBUTTONUP](#cwnd__onmbuttonup) messages, the `WM_MBUTTONDBLCLK` call, and another `WM_MBUTTONUP` message.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  This member function is called by the framework to allow your application to handle a Windows message.

When received by an MDI child window, `pActivateWnd` contains a pointer to the child window being activated. This pointer may be temporary and should not be stored for later use.  \n  \n *pDeactivateWnd*  \n Contains a pointer to the MDI child window being deactivated. This pointer may be temporary and should not be stored for later use.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n An MDI child window is activated independently of the MDI frame window. When the frame becomes active, the child window that was last activated with a `OnMDIActivate` call receives an [WM_NCACTIVATE](#cwnd__onncactivate) message to draw an active window frame and caption bar, but it does not receive another `OnMDIActivate` call.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  This member function is called by the framework to allow your application to handle a Windows message. The parameters passed to your function reflect the parameters received by the framework when the message was received. If you call the base-class implementation of this function, that implementation will use the parameters originally passed with the message and not the parameters you supply to the function.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__onmeasureitem\"></a>  CWnd::OnMeasureItem  \n The framework calls this member function by the framework for the owner of an owner-draw button, combo box, list box, or menu item when the control is created.  \n  \n```  \nafx_msg void OnMeasureItem(\n    int nIDCtl, LPMEASUREITEMSTRUCT lpMeasureItemStruct);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `nIDCtl`  \n The ID of the control.  \n  \n `lpMeasureItemStruct`  \n Points to a [MEASUREITEMSTRUCT](../../mfc/reference/measureitemstruct-structure.md) data structure that contains the dimensions of the owner-draw control.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n Override this member function and fill in the `MEASUREITEMSTRUCT` data structure pointed to by `lpMeasureItemStruct` and return; this informs Windows of the dimensions of the control and allows Windows to process user interaction with the control correctly.  \n  \n If a list box or combo box is created with the [LBS_OWNERDRAWVARIABLE](../../mfc/reference/list-box-styles.md) or [CBS_OWNERDRAWVARIABLE](../../mfc/reference/combo-box-styles.md) style, the framework calls this function for the owner for each item in the control; otherwise this function is called once.  \n  \n Windows initiates the call to `OnMeasureItem` for the owner of combo boxes and list boxes created with the **OWNERDRAWFIXED** style before sending the [WM_INITDIALOG](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms645428) message. As a result, when the owner receives this call, Windows has not yet determined the height and width of the font used in the control; function calls and calculations that require these values should occur in the main function of the application or library.  \n  \n If the item being measured is a `CMenu`, `CListBox` or `CComboBox` object, then the `MeasureItem` virtual function of the appropriate class is called. Override the `MeasureItem` member function of the appropriate control's class to calculate and set the size of each item.  \n  \n `OnMeasureItem` will be called only if the control's class is created at run time, or it is created with the **LBS_OWNERDRAWVARIABLE** or **CBS_OWNERDRAWVARIABLE** style. If the control is created by the dialog editor, `OnMeasureItem` will not be called. This is because the [WM_MEASUREITEM](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb775925) message is sent early in the creation process of the control. If you subclass by using `DDX_Control`, `SubclassDlgItem`, or `SubclassWindow`, the subclassing usually occurs after the creation process. Therefore, there is no way to handle the [WM_MEASUREITEM](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb775925) message in the control's `OnChildNotify` function, which is the mechanism MFC uses to implement **ON_WM_MEASUREITEM_REFLECT**.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  This member function is called by the framework to allow your application to handle a Windows message. The parameters passed to your function reflect the parameters received by the framework when the message was received. If you call the base-class implementation of this function, that implementation will use the parameters originally passed with the message and not the parameters you supply to the function.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__onmenuchar\"></a>  CWnd::OnMenuChar  \n The framework calls this member function when the user presses a menu mnemonic character that doesn't match any of the predefined mnemonics in the current menu.  \n  \n```  \nafx_msg LRESULT OnMenuChar(\n    UINT nChar,  \n    UINT nFlags,  \n    CMenu* pMenu);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `nChar`  \n Depending on the build settings, specifies the ANSI or Unicode character that the user pressed.  \n  \n `nFlags`  \n Contains the **MF_POPUP** flag if the menu is a pop-up menu. It contains the **MF_SYSMENU** flag if the menu is a Control menu.  \n  \n `pMenu`  \n Contains a pointer to the selected `CMenu`. The pointer may be temporary and should not be stored.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n The high-order word of the return value should contain one of the following command codes:  \n  \n|Value|Description|  \n|-----------|-----------------|  \n|0|Tells Windows to discard the character that the user pressed and creates a short beep on the system speaker.|  \n|1|Tells Windows to close the current menu.|  \n|2|Informs Windows that the low-order word of the return value contains the item number for a specific item. This item is selected by Windows.|  \n  \n The low-order word is ignored if the high-order word contains 0 or 1. Applications should process this message when accelerator (shortcut) keys are used to select bitmaps placed in a menu.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n It is sent to the `CWnd` that owns the menu. `OnMenuChar` is also called when the user presses ALT and any other key, even if the key does not correspond to a mnemonic character. In this case, `pMenu` points to the menu owned by the `CWnd`, and `nFlags` is 0.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  This member function is called by the framework to allow your application to handle a Windows message.

The [WM_MENURBUTTONUP](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms647610) message enables an application to provide a context-sensitive menu for the menu item specified in the message.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  This member function is called by the framework to allow your application to handle a Windows message.

This parameter can be any combination of the following values:  \n  \n- **MK_CONTROL** Set if the CTRL key is down.  \n  \n- **MK_LBUTTON** Set if the left mouse button is down.  \n  \n- **MK_MBUTTON** Set if the middle mouse button is down.  \n  \n- **MK_RBUTTON** Set if the right mouse button is down.  \n  \n- **MK_SHIFT** Set if the SHIFT key is down.  \n  \n `point`  \n Specifies the x- and y-coordinate of the cursor. These coordinates are always relative to the upper-left corner of the window.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n If the mouse is not captured, the `WM_MOUSEMOVE` message is received by the `CWnd` object beneath the mouse cursor; otherwise, the message goes to the window that has captured the mouse.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  This member function is called by the framework to allow your application to handle a Windows message. The parameters passed to your function reflect the parameters received by the framework when the message was received. If you call the base-class implementation of this function, that implementation will use the parameters originally passed with the message and not the parameters you supply to the function.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__onmousewheel\"></a>  CWnd::OnMouseWheel  \n The framework calls this member function as a user rotates the mouse wheel and encounters the wheel's next notch.  \n  \n```  \nafx_msg BOOL OnMouseWheel(\n    UINT nFlags,  \n    short zDelta,  \n    CPoint pt);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `nFlags`  \n Indicates whether various virtual keys are down. This parameter can be any combination of the following values:  \n  \n- **MK_CONTROL** Set if the CTRL key is down.  \n  \n- **MK_LBUTTON** Set if the left mouse button is down.  \n  \n- **MK_MBUTTON** Set if the middle mouse button is down.  \n  \n- **MK_RBUTTON** Set if the right mouse button is down.  \n  \n- **MK_SHIFT** Set if the SHIFT key is down.  \n  \n `zDelta`  \n Indicates distance rotated. The `zDelta` value is expressed in multiples or divisions of **WHEEL_DELTA**, which is 120. A value less than zero indicates rotating back (toward the user) while a value greater than zero indicates rotating forward (away from the user). The user can reverse this response by changing the Wheel setting in the mouse software. See the Remarks for more information about this parameter.  \n  \n `pt`  \n Specifies the x- and y-coordinate of the cursor. These coordinates are always relative to the upper-left corner of the screen.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Nonzero if mouse wheel scrolling is enabled; otherwise 0.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n Unless overridden, `OnMouseWheel` calls the default of [WM_MOUSEWHEEL](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms645617). Windows automatically routes the message to the control or child window that has the focus. The Win32 function [DefWindowProc](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms633572) propagates the message up the parent chain to the window that processes it.  \n  \n The `zDelta` parameter is a multiple of **WHEEL_DELTA**, which is set at 120. This value is the threshold for an action to be taken, and one such action (for example, scrolling forward one notch) should occur for each delta.  \n  \n **WHEEL_DELTA** was set to 120 to allow for finer-resolution wheels, such as a freely-rotating wheel with no notches. A finer-resolution wheel sends more messages per rotation, but each message has a smaller delta value. To use such a wheel, either add the incoming `zDelta` values until **WHEEL_DELTA** is reached (so that you get the same response for a given delta-rotation), or scroll partial lines in response to the more frequent messages. You can also choose a scroll granularity and accumulate deltas until **WHEEL_DELTA** is reached.  \n  \n Override this member function to provide your own mouse-wheel scrolling behavior.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n> `OnMouseWheel` handles messages for Windows NT 4.0 and later versions. For Windows 95/98 or Windows NT 3.51 message handling, use [OnRegisteredMouseWheel](#cwnd__onregisteredmousewheel).  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__onmove\"></a>  CWnd::OnMove  \n The framework calls this member function after the `CWnd` object has been moved.  \n  \n```  \nafx_msg void OnMove(\n    int x,  \n    int y);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n *x*  \n Specifies the new x-coordinate location of the upper-left corner of the client area. This new location is given in screen coordinates for overlapped and pop-up windows, and parent-client coordinates for child windows.  \n  \n *y*  \n Specifies the new y-coordinate location of the upper-left corner of the client area. This new location is given in screen coordinates for overlapped and pop-up windows, and parent-client coordinates for child windows.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  This member function is called by the framework to allow your application to handle a Windows message. The parameters passed to your function reflect the parameters received by the framework when the message was received. If you call the base-class implementation of this function, that implementation will use the parameters originally passed with the message and not the parameters you supply to the function.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__onmoving\"></a>  CWnd::OnMoving  \n The framework calls this member function while a user is moving a `CWnd` object.  \n  \n```  \nafx_msg void OnMoving(\n    UINT nSide,  \n    LPRECT lpRect);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `nSide`  \n The edge of window to be moved.  \n  \n `lpRect`  \n Address of the [CRect](../../atl-mfc-shared/reference/crect-class.md) or [RECT structure](../../mfc/reference/rect-structure1.md) that will contain the item's coordinates.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  This member function is called by the framework to allow your application to handle a Windows message. The parameters passed to your function reflect the parameters received by the framework when the message was received. If you call the base-class implementation of this function, that implementation will use the parameters originally passed with the message and not the parameters you supply to the function.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__onncactivate\"></a>  CWnd::OnNcActivate  \n The framework calls this member function when the nonclient area needs to be changed to indicate an active or inactive state.  \n  \n```  \nafx_msg BOOL OnNcActivate(BOOL bActive);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `bActive`  \n Specifies when a caption bar or icon needs to be changed to indicate an active or inactive state. The `bActive` parameter is **TRUE** if an active caption or icon is to be drawn. It is **FALSE** for an inactive caption or icon.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Nonzero if Windows should proceed with default processing; 0 to prevent the caption bar or icon from being deactivated.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The default implementation draws the title bar and title-bar text in their active colors if `bActive` is **TRUE** and in their inactive colors if `bActive` is **FALSE**.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  This member function is called by the framework to allow your application to handle a Windows message.

If you call the base-class implementation of this function, that implementation will use the parameters originally passed with the message and not the parameters you supply to the function.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__onnccalcsize\"></a>  CWnd::OnNcCalcSize  \n The framework calls this member function when the size and position of the client area needs to be calculated.  \n  \n```  \nafx_msg void OnNcCalcSize(\n    BOOL bCalcValidRects,  \n    NCCALCSIZE_PARAMS* lpncsp);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `bCalcValidRects`  \n Specifies whether the application should specify which part of the client area contains valid information. Windows will copy the valid information to the specified area within the new client area. If this parameter is **TRUE**, the application should specify which part of the client area is valid.  \n  \n `lpncsp`  \n Points to a [NCCALCSIZE_PARAMS](../../mfc/reference/nccalcsize-params-structure.md) data structure that contains information an application can use to calculate the new size and position of the `CWnd` rectangle (including client area, borders, caption, scroll bars, and so on).  \n  \n### Remarks  \n By processing this message, an application can control the contents of the window's client area when the size or position of the window changes.  \n  \n Regardless of the value of `bCalcValidRects`, the first rectangle in the array specified by the **rgrc** structure member of the `NCCALCSIZE_PARAMS` structure contains the coordinates of the window. For a child window, the coordinates are relative to the parent window's client area. For top-level windows, the coordinates are screen coordinates. An application should modify the **rgrc[0]** rectangle to reflect the size and position of the client area.  \n  \n The **rgrc[1]** and **rgrc[2]** rectangles are valid only if `bCalcValidRects` is **TRUE**. In this case, the **rgrc[1]** rectangle contains the coordinates of the window before it was moved or resized. The **rgrc[2]** rectangle contains the coordinates of the window's client area before the window was moved. All coordinates are relative to the parent window or screen.  \n  \n The default implementation calculates the size of the client area based on the window characteristics (presence of scroll bars, menu, and so on), and places the result in `lpncsp`.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  This member function is called by the framework to allow your application to handle a Windows message. The parameters passed to your function reflect the parameters received by the framework when the message was received. If you call the base-class implementation of this function, that implementation will use the parameters originally passed with the message and not the parameters you supply to the function.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__onnccreate\"></a>  CWnd::OnNcCreate  \n The framework calls this member function prior to the [WM_CREATE](#cwnd__oncreate) message when the `CWnd` object is first created.  \n  \n```  \nafx_msg BOOL OnNcCreate(LPCREATESTRUCT lpCreateStruct);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `lpCreateStruct`  \n Points to the [CREATESTRUCT](../../mfc/reference/createstruct-structure.md) data structure for `CWnd`.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Nonzero if the nonclient area is created. It is 0 if an error occurs; the **Create** function will return **failure** in this case.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  This member function is called by the framework to allow your application to handle a Windows message. The parameters passed to your function reflect the parameters received by the framework when the message was received. If you call the base-class implementation of this function, that implementation will use the parameters originally passed with the message and not the parameters you supply to the function.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__onncdestroy\"></a>  CWnd::OnNcDestroy  \n Called by the framework when the nonclient area is being destroyed, and is the last member function called when the Windows window is destroyed.  \n  \n```  \nafx_msg void OnNcDestroy();\n```  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The default implementation performs some cleanup, then calls the virtual member function [PostNcDestroy](#cwnd__postncdestroy).  \n  \n Override `PostNcDestroy` if you want to perform your own cleanup, such as a **delete this** operation. If you override `OnNcDestroy`, you must call `OnNcDestroy` in your base class to ensure that any memory internally allocated for the window is freed.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__onnchittest\"></a>  CWnd::OnNcHitTest  \n The framework calls this member function for the `CWnd` object that contains the cursor (or the `CWnd` object that used the [SetCapture](#cwnd__setcapture) member function to capture the mouse input) every time the mouse is moved.  \n  \n```  \nafx_msg LRESULT OnNcHitTest(CPoint point);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `point`  \n Contains the x- and y-coordinates of the cursor.

In this case, the window may not have an update region. An application should call the [GetUpdateRect](#cwnd__getupdaterect) member function to determine whether the window has an update region. If `GetUpdateRect` returns 0, the application should not call the [BeginPaint](#cwnd__beginpaint) and [EndPaint](#cwnd__endpaint) member functions.  \n  \n It is an application's responsibility to check for any necessary internal repainting or updating by looking at its internal data structures for each `WM_PAINT` message because a `WM_PAINT` message may have been caused by both an invalid area and a call to the `RedrawWindow` member function with the **RDW_INTERNALPAINT** flag set.  \n  \n An internal `WM_PAINT` message is sent only once by Windows. After an internal `WM_PAINT` message is sent to a window by the `UpdateWindow` member function, no further `WM_PAINT` messages will be sent or posted until the window is invalidated or until the `RedrawWindow` member function is called again with the **RDW_INTERNALPAINT** flag set.  \n  \n For information on rendering an image in document/view applications, see [CView::OnDraw](../../mfc/reference/cview-class.md#cview__ondraw).  \n  \n For more information about using **WM_Paint**, see the following topics in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../../atl/includes/winsdk_md.md)]:  \n  \n- [The WM_PAINT Message](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd145137)  \n  \n- [Using the WM_PAINT Message](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd145193)  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__onpaintclipboard\"></a>  CWnd::OnPaintClipboard  \n A Clipboard owner's `OnPaintClipboard` member function is called by a Clipboard viewer when the Clipboard owner has placed data on the Clipboard in the `CF_OWNERDISPLAY` format and the Clipboard viewer's client area needs repainting.  \n  \n```  \nafx_msg void OnPaintClipboard(\n    CWnd* pClipAppWnd,  \n    HGLOBAL hPaintStruct);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `pClipAppWnd`  \n Specifies a pointer to the Clipboard-application window. The pointer may be temporary and should not be stored for later use.  \n  \n *hPaintStruct*  \n Identifies a [PAINTSTRUCT](../../mfc/reference/paintstruct-structure.md) data structure that defines what part of the client area to paint.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n To determine whether the entire client area or just a portion of it needs repainting, the Clipboard owner must compare the dimensions of the drawing area given in the **rcpaint** member of the `PAINTSTRUCT` structure to the dimensions given in the most recent [OnSizeClipboard](#cwnd__onsizeclipboard) member function call.  \n  \n `OnPaintClipboard` should use the [GlobalLock](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa366584) Windows function to lock the memory that contains the `PAINTSTRUCT` data structure and unlock that memory with the [GlobalUnlock](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa366595) Windows function before it exits.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  This member function is called by the framework to allow your application to handle a Windows message. The parameters passed to your function reflect the parameters received by the framework when the message was received.

The pointer may be temporary and should not be stored.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n This call allows a window without the input focus that uses a color palette to realize its logical palettes and update its client area.  \n  \n The `OnPaletteChanged` member function is called for all top-level and overlapped windows, including the one that changed the system palette and caused the `WM_PALETTECHANGED` message to be sent. If any child window uses a color palette, this message must be passed on to it.  \n  \n To avoid an infinite loop, the window shouldn't realize its palette unless it determines that `pFocusWnd` does not contain a pointer to itself.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  This member function is called by the framework to allow your application to handle a Windows message. The parameters passed to your function reflect the parameters received by the framework when the message was received.

The parameters passed to your function reflect the parameters received by the framework when the message was received. If you call the base-class implementation of this function, that implementation will use the parameters originally passed with the message and not the parameters you supply to the function.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__onparentnotify\"></a>  CWnd::OnParentNotify  \n A parent's `OnParentNotify` member function is called by the framework when its child window is created or destroyed, or when the user clicks a mouse button while the cursor is over the child window.  \n  \n```  \nafx_msg void OnParentNotify(\n    UINT message,  \n    LPARAM lParam);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `message`  \n Specifies the event for which the parent is being notified and the identifier of the child window. The event is the low-order word of `message`. If the event is `WM_CREATE` or `WM_DESTROY`, the high-order word of `message` is the identifier of the child window; otherwise, the high-order word is undefined. The event (low-order word of `message`) can be any of these values:  \n  \n- `WM_CREATE` The child window is being created.  \n  \n- `WM_DESTROY` The child window is being destroyed.  \n  \n- `WM_LBUTTONDOWN` The user has placed the mouse cursor over the child window and clicked the left mouse button.  \n  \n- `WM_MBUTTONDOWN` The user has placed the mouse cursor over the child window and clicked the middle mouse button.  \n  \n- `WM_RBUTTONDOWN` The user has placed the mouse cursor over the child window and clicked the right mouse button.  \n  \n `lParam`  \n If the event (low-order word) of `message` is `WM_CREATE` or `WM_DESTROY`, `lParam` specifies the window handle of the child window; otherwise `lParam` contains the x and y coordinates of the cursor. The x coordinate is in the low-order word and the y coordinate is in the high-order word.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n When the child window is being created, the system calls `OnParentNotify` just before the [Create](#cwnd__create) member function that creates the window returns. When the child window is being destroyed, the system calls `OnParentNotify` before any processing takes place to destroy the window.  \n  \n `OnParentNotify` is called for all ancestor windows of the child window, including the top-level window.  \n  \n All child windows except those that have the [WS_EX_NOPARENTNOTIFY](../../mfc/reference/extended-window-styles.md) style send this message to their parent windows. By default, child windows in a dialog box have the **WS_EX_NOPARENTNOTIFY** style unless the child window was created without this style by calling the [CreateEx](#cwnd__createex) member function.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  This member function is called by the framework to allow your application to handle a Windows message. The parameters passed to your function reflect the parameters received by the framework when the message was received. If you call the base-class implementation of this function, that implementation will use the parameters originally passed with the message and not the parameters you supply to the function.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__onpowerbroadcast\"></a>  CWnd::OnPowerBroadcast  \n The framework calls this member function when a power-management event occurs.  \n  \n```  \nafx_msg UINT OnPowerBroadcast(\n    UINT nPowerEvent,   \n    UINT nEventData);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n  \n|Parameter|Description|  \n|---------------|-----------------|  \n|[in] `nPowerEvent`|The power-management event.|  \n|[in] `nEventData`|Event-specific data.|  \n  \n### Return Value  \n If the event is a request, return `true` to grant the request, or `BROADCAST_QUERY_DENY` to deny the request.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n This method receives the [WM_POWERBROADCAST](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa373247) message, which is described in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../../atl/includes/winsdk_md.md)].  \n  \n The `nPowerEvent` parameter specifies events such as battery power is low, the power status has changed, permission to suspend operation is requested or denied, an operation is resuming automatically after an event, the system is suspending operation, or an operation is resuming after suspension. The `nEventData` parameter is typically not used. For more information, see the `wParam` and `lParam` parameters of the [WM_POWERBROADCAST](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa373247) message.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  This member function is called by the framework to allow your application to handle a Windows message.

The cursor or icon must be compatible with the display driver's resolution. If the application returns **NULL**, the system displays the default cursor. The default return value is **NULL**.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The system makes this call to obtain the cursor to display while the user drags the minimized window. If an application returns the handle of an icon or cursor, the system converts it to black-and-white. If an application returns a handle, the handle must identify a monochrome cursor or icon compatible with the display driver's resolution. The application can call the [CWinApp::LoadCursor](../../mfc/reference/cwinapp-class.md#cwinapp__loadcursor) or [CWinApp::LoadIcon](../../mfc/reference/cwinapp-class.md#cwinapp__loadicon) member functions to load a cursor or icon from the resources in its executable file and to obtain this handle.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__onqueryendsession\"></a>  CWnd::OnQueryEndSession  \n The framework calls this member function when the user chooses to end the Windows session or when an application calls the [ExitWindows](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa376867) Windows function.  \n  \n```  \nafx_msg BOOL OnQueryEndSession();\n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Nonzero if an application can be conveniently shut down; otherwise 0.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n If any application returns 0, the Windows session is not ended. Windows stops calling `OnQueryEndSession` as soon as one application returns 0 and sends the [WM_ENDSESSION](#cwnd__onendsession) message with a parameter value of **FALSE** for any application that has already returned nonzero.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__onquerynewpalette\"></a>  CWnd::OnQueryNewPalette  \n The framework calls this member function when the `CWnd` object is about to receive the input focus, giving the `CWnd` an opportunity to realize its logical palette when it receives the focus.  \n  \n```  \nafx_msg BOOL OnQueryNewPalette();\n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Nonzero if the `CWnd` realizes its logical palette; otherwise 0.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__onqueryopen\"></a>  CWnd::OnQueryOpen  \n The framework calls this member function when the `CWnd` object is minimized and the user requests that the `CWnd` be restored to its preminimized size and position.  \n  \n```  \nafx_msg BOOL OnQueryOpen();\n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Nonzero if the icon can be opened, or 0 to prevent the icon from being opened.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n While in `OnQueryOpen`, `CWnd` should not perform any action that would cause an activation or focus change (for example, creating a dialog box).  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__onqueryuistate\"></a>  CWnd::OnQueryUIState  \n Called to retrieve the user interface (UI) state for a window.  \n  \n```  \nafx_msg UINT OnQueryUIState();\n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n The return value is **NULL** if the focus indicators and the keyboard accelerators are visible. Otherwise, the return value can be one or more of the following values:  \n  \n- **UISF_HIDEFOCUS** Focus indicators are hidden.  \n  \n- **UISF_HIDEACCEL** Keyboard accelerators are hidden.  \n  \n- **UISF_ACTIVE Windows XP:** A control should be drawn in the style used for active controls.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n This member function emulates the functionality of the [WM_QUERYUISTATE](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms646355) message, as described in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../../atl/includes/winsdk_md.md)].  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__onrawinput\"></a>  CWnd::OnRawInput  \n The framework calls this member function when the current window gets raw input.  \n  \n```  \nafx_msg void OnRawInput(\n    UINT nInputCode,  \n    HRAWINPUT hRawInput);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n  \n|Parameter|Description|  \n|---------------|-----------------|  \n|[in] `nInputCode`|Input code that indicates whether the input occurred while the application was in the foreground or not. In either case, the application must call [CWnd::DefWindowProc](#cwnd__defwindowproc) so the system can perform cleanup.<br /><br /> This parameter can be one of the following values:<br /><br /> - `RIM_INPUT` - Input occurred while the application was in the foreground.<br />- `RIM_INPUTSINK` - Input occurred while the application was not in the foreground.|  \n|[in] `hRawInput`|Handle to a [RAWINPUT](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms645562) structure that contains the raw input from the device.|  \n  \n### Remarks  \n This method receives the [WM_INPUT](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms646275) notification, which is described in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../../atl/includes/winsdk_md.md)].  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  This member function is called by the framework to allow your application to handle a Windows message.

This parameter can be any combination of the following values:  \n  \n- **MK_CONTROL** Set if CTRL key is down.  \n  \n- **MK_LBUTTON** Set if left mouse button is down.  \n  \n- **MK_MBUTTON** Set if middle mouse button is down.  \n  \n- **MK_RBUTTON** Set if right mouse button is down.  \n  \n- **MK_SHIFT** Set if SHIFT key is down.  \n  \n `point`  \n Specifies the x and y coordinates of the cursor. These coordinates are always relative to the upper-left corner of the window.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n Only windows that have the **CS_DBLCLKS** [WNDCLASS](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms633576) style can receive `OnRButtonDblClk` calls. This is the default for windows within the Microsoft Foundation Class Library. Windows calls `OnRButtonDblClk` when the user presses, releases, and then again presses the right mouse button within the system's double-click time limit. Double-clicking the right mouse button actually generates four events: [WM_RBUTTONDOWN](#cwnd__onrbuttondown) and [WM_RBUTTONUP](#cwnd__onrbuttonup) messages, the `OnRButtonDblClk` call, and another `WM_RBUTTONUP` message when the button is released.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  This member function is called by the framework to allow your application to handle a Windows message. The parameters passed to your function reflect the parameters received by the framework when the message was received. If you call the base-class implementation of this function, that implementation will use the parameters originally passed with the message and not the parameters you supply to the function.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__onrbuttondown\"></a>  CWnd::OnRButtonDown  \n The framework calls this member function when the user presses the right mouse button.  \n  \n```  \nafx_msg void OnRButtonDown(\n    UINT nFlags,  \n    CPoint point);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `nFlags`  \n Indicates whether various virtual keys are down. This parameter can be any combination of the following values:  \n  \n- **MK_CONTROL** Set if CTRL key is down.  \n  \n- **MK_LBUTTON** Set if left mouse button is down.  \n  \n- **MK_MBUTTON** Set if middle mouse button is down.  \n  \n- **MK_RBUTTON** Set if right mouse button is down.  \n  \n- **MK_SHIFT** Set if SHIFT key is down.  \n  \n `point`  \n Specifies the x and y coordinates of the cursor. These coordinates are always relative to the upper-left corner of the window.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n This member function is called by the framework to allow your application to handle a Windows message. The parameters passed to your function reflect the parameters received by the framework when the message was received. If you call the base-class implementation of this function, that implementation will use the parameters originally passed with the message and not the parameters you supply to the function.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__onrbuttonup\"></a>  CWnd::OnRButtonUp  \n The framework calls this member function when the user releases the right mouse button.  \n  \n```  \nafx_msg void OnRButtonUp(\n    UINT nFlags,  \n    CPoint point);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `nFlags`  \n Indicates whether various virtual keys are down. This parameter can be any combination of the following values:  \n  \n- **MK_CONTROL** Set if CTRL key is down.  \n  \n- **MK_LBUTTON** Set if left mouse button is down.  \n  \n- **MK_MBUTTON** Set if middle mouse button is down.  \n  \n- **MK_SHIFT** Set if SHIFT key is down.  \n  \n `point`  \n Specifies the x and y coordinates of the cursor. These coordinates are always relative to the upper-left corner of the window.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n This member function is called by the framework to allow your application to handle a Windows message. The parameters passed to your function reflect the parameters received by the framework when the message was received. If you call the base-class implementation of this function, that implementation will use the parameters originally passed with the message and not the parameters you supply to the function.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__onregisteredmousewheel\"></a>  CWnd::OnRegisteredMouseWheel  \n The framework calls this member function as a user rotates the mouse wheel and encounters the wheel's next notch.  \n  \n```  \nafx_msg LRESULT OnRegisteredMouseWheel(\n    WPARAM wParam,  \n    LPARAM lParam);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `wParam`  \n Horizontal position of the pointer.  \n  \n `lParam`  \n Vertical position of the pointer.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Insignificant at this time. Always zero.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n Unless overridden, `OnRegisteredMouseWheel` routes the message to the appropriate window (the parent window with focus), and calls the [WM_MOUSEWHEEL](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms645617) handler for that window.  \n  \n Override this member function to provide your own message routing or to alter the mouse-wheel scrolling behavior.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n> `OnRegisteredMouseWheel` handles messages for Windows 95/98 and Windows NT 3.51. For Windows NT 4.0 message handling, use [OnMouseWheel](#cwnd__onmousewheel).  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__onrenderallformats\"></a>  CWnd::OnRenderAllFormats  \n The Clipboard owner's `OnRenderAllFormats` member function is called by the framework when the owner application is being destroyed.  \n  \n```  \nafx_msg void OnRenderAllFormats();\n```  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The Clipboard owner should render the data in all the formats it is capable of generating and pass a data handle for each format to the Clipboard by calling the [SetClipboardData](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms649051) Windows function. This ensures that the Clipboard contains valid data even though the application that rendered the data is destroyed. The application should call the [OpenClipboard](#cwnd__openclipboard) member function before calling the [SetClipboardData](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms649051) Windows function and call the [CloseClipboard](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms649035) Windows function afterward.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__onrenderformat\"></a>  CWnd::OnRenderFormat  \n The Clipboard owner's `OnRenderFormat` member function is called by the framework when a particular format with delayed rendering needs to be rendered.  \n  \n```  \nafx_msg void OnRenderFormat(UINT nFormat);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `nFormat`  \n Specifies the Clipboard format.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The receiver should render the data in that format and pass it to the Clipboard by calling the [SetClipboardData](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms649051) Windows function.  \n  \n Do not call the `OpenClipboard` member function or the **CloseClipboard** Windows function from within `OnRenderFormat`.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  This member function is called by the framework to allow your application to handle a Windows message. The parameters passed to your function reflect the parameters received by the framework when the message was received. If you call the base-class implementation of this function, that implementation will use the parameters originally passed with the message and not the parameters you supply to the function.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__onsessionchange\"></a>  CWnd::OnSessionChange  \n The framework calls this member function to notify an application of a change in session state.  \n  \n```  \nafx_msg void OnSessionChange(\n    UINT nSessionState,   \n    UINT nId);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n  \n|Parameter|Description|  \n|---------------|-----------------|  \n|[in] `nSessionState`|A status code describes the session state change.|  \n|[in] `nId`|A session identifier.|  \n  \n### Remarks  \n This method receives the [WM_WTSSESSION_CHANGE](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa383828) notification, which is described in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../../atl/includes/winsdk_md.md)].  \n  \n The `nSessionState` parameter specifies that a session is connected or disconnected from the console or a remote terminal, a user logged on or off, a session is locked or unlocked, or a session has changed to remote-controlled status. For more information, see the `wParam` parameter of the the [WM_WTSSESSION_CHANGE](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa383828) message.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  This member function is called by the framework to allow your application to handle a Windows message. The parameters passed to your function reflect the parameters received by the framework when the message was received. If you call the base-class implementation of this function, that implementation will use the parameters originally passed with the message and not the parameters you supply to the function.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__onsetcursor\"></a>  CWnd::OnSetCursor  \n The framework calls this member function if mouse input is not captured and the mouse causes cursor movement within the `CWnd` object.  \n  \n```  \nafx_msg BOOL OnSetCursor(\n    CWnd* pWnd,  \n    UINT nHitTest,  \n    UINT message);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `pWnd`  \n Specifies a pointer to the window that contains the cursor. The pointer may be temporary and should not be stored for later use.  \n  \n `nHitTest`  \n Specifies the [hit-test](#cwnd__onnchittest) area code. The hit test determines the cursor's location.  \n  \n `message`  \n Specifies the mouse message number.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Nonzero to halt further processing, or 0 to continue.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The default implementation calls the parent window's `OnSetCursor` before processing. If the parent window returns **TRUE**, further processing is halted. Calling the parent window gives the parent window control over the cursor's setting in a child window.  \n  \n The default implementation sets the cursor to an arrow if it is not in the client area or to the registered-class cursor if it is.  \n  \n If `nHitTest` is **HTERROR** and `message` is a mouse button-down message, the **MessageBeep** member function is called.  \n  \n The `message` parameter is 0 when `CWnd` enters menu mode.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  This member function is called by the framework to allow your application to handle a Windows message. The parameters passed to your function reflect the parameters received by the framework when the message was received. If you call the base-class implementation of this function, that implementation will use the parameters originally passed with the message and not the parameters you supply to the function.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__onsetfocus\"></a>  CWnd::OnSetFocus  \n The framework calls this member function after gaining the input focus.  \n  \n```  \nafx_msg void OnSetFocus(CWnd* pOldWnd);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n *pOldWnd*  \n Contains the `CWnd` object that loses the input focus (may be **NULL**). The pointer may be temporary and should not be stored for later use.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n To display a caret, `CWnd` should call the appropriate caret functions at this point.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  This member function is called by the framework to allow your application to handle a Windows message. The parameters passed to your function reflect the parameters received by the framework when the message was received. If you call the base-class implementation of this function, that implementation will use the parameters originally passed with the message and not the parameters you supply to the function.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__onsettingchange\"></a>  CWnd::OnSettingChange  \n The framework calls `OnSettingChange` for all top-level windows when the Win32 SystemParametersInfo function changes a system-wide setting.  \n  \n```  \nafx_msg void OnSettingChange(\n    UINT uFlags,  \n    LPCTSTR lpszSection);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `uFlags`  \n When the system sends the message as a result of a **SystemParametersInfo** call, this parameter is a flag that indicates the system parameter that was changed. For a list of values, see [SystemParametersInfo](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms724947) in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../../atl/includes/winsdk_md.md)]. When an application sends the message, this parameter must be 0.  \n  \n `lpszSection`  \n Points to a string that specifies the name of the section that has changed. (The string does not include the square brackets that enclose the section name.)  \n  \n### Remarks  \n An application should send the message to all top-level windows when it makes changes to system parameters, and Windows will send the message if the user changes settings via the Control Panel.  \n  \n The **ON_WM_SETTINGCHANGE** message is similar to the **ON_WM_WININICHANGE** message, with the following difference:  \n  \n-   Use **ON_WM_SETTINGCHANGE** when running Windows NT 4.0 or newer, or under Windows 95/98.  \n  \n-   Use **ON_WININICHANGE** when running Windows NT 3.51 or older. This message is now obsolete.  \n  \n You should have only one of these macros in your message map. To write a program that works for both Windows 95/98 and Windows NT 4.0, write a handler for **ON_WM_SETTINGCHANGE**. Under Windows NT 3.51, your handler will be called by `OnSettingChange` and `uFlags` and will always be zero.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__onshowwindow\"></a>  CWnd::OnShowWindow  \n The framework calls this member function when the `CWnd` object is about to be hidden or shown.  \n  \n```  \nafx_msg void OnShowWindow(\n    BOOL bShow,  \n    UINT nStatus);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `bShow`  \n Specifies whether a window is being shown. It is **TRUE** if the window is being shown; it is **FALSE** if the window is being hidden.  \n  \n `nStatus`  \n Specifies the status of the window being shown. It is 0 if the message is sent because of a `ShowWindow` member function call; otherwise `nStatus` is one of the following:  \n  \n- **SW_PARENTCLOSING** Parent window is closing (being made iconic) or a pop-up window is being hidden.  \n  \n- **SW_PARENTOPENING** Parent window is opening (being displayed) or a pop-up window is being shown.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n A window is hidden or shown when the `ShowWindow` member function is called, when an overlapped window is maximized or restored, or when an overlapped or pop-up window is closed (made iconic) or opened (displayed on the screen). When an overlapped window is closed, all pop-up windows associated with that window are hidden.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  This member function is called by the framework to allow your application to handle a Windows message. The parameters passed to your function reflect the parameters received by the framework when the message was received. If you call the base-class implementation of this function, that implementation will use the parameters originally passed with the message and not the parameters you supply to the function.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__onsize\"></a>  CWnd::OnSize  \n The framework calls this member function after the window's size has changed.  \n  \n```  \nafx_msg void OnSize(\n    UINT nType,  \n    int cx,  \n    int cy);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `nType`  \n Specifies the type of resizing requested. This parameter can be one of the following values:  \n  \n- **SIZE_MAXIMIZED** Window has been maximized.  \n  \n- **SIZE_MINIMIZED** Window has been minimized.  \n  \n- **SIZE_RESTORED** Window has been resized, but neither **SIZE_MINIMIZED** nor **SIZE_MAXIMIZED** applies.  \n  \n- **SIZE_MAXHIDE** Message is sent to all pop-up windows when some other window is maximized.  \n  \n- **SIZE_MAXSHOW** Message is sent to all pop-up windows when some other window has been restored to its former size.  \n  \n `cx`  \n Specifies the new width of the client area.  \n  \n `cy`  \n Specifies the new height of the client area.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n If the [SetScrollPos](#cwnd__setscrollpos) or [MoveWindow](#cwnd__movewindow) member function is called for a child window from `OnSize`, the `bRedraw` parameter of `SetScrollPos` or `MoveWindow` should be nonzero to cause the `CWnd` to be repainted.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  This member function is called by the framework to allow your application to handle a Windows message. The parameters passed to your function reflect the parameters received by the framework when the message was received. If you call the base-class implementation of this function, that implementation will use the parameters originally passed with the message and not the parameters you supply to the function.  \n  \n### Example  \n [!code-cpp[NVC_MFCWindowing#109](../../mfc/reference/codesnippet/cpp/cwnd-class_50.cpp)]  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__onsizeclipboard\"></a>  CWnd::OnSizeClipboard  \n The Clipboard owner's `OnSizeClipboard` member function is called by the Clipboard viewer when the Clipboard contains data with the `CF_OWNERDISPLAY` attribute and the size of the client area of the Clipboard-viewer window has changed.  \n  \n```  \nafx_msg void OnSizeClipboard(\n    CWnd* pClipAppWnd,  \n    HGLOBAL hRect);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `pClipAppWnd`  \n Identifies the Clipboard-application window. The pointer may be temporary and should not be stored.  \n  \n *hRect*  \n Identifies a global memory object. The memory object contains a RECT data structure that specifies the area for the Clipboard owner to paint.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The `OnSizeClipboard` member function is called with a null rectangle (0,0,0,0) as the new size when the Clipboard application is about to be destroyed or minimized. This permits the Clipboard owner to free its display resources.  \n  \n Within `OnSizeClipboard`, an application must use the [GlobalLock](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa366584) Windows function to lock the memory that contains the RECT data structure. Have the application unlock that memory with the [GlobalUnlock](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa366595) Windows function before it yields or returns control.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  This member function is called by the framework to allow your application to handle a Windows message.

The value is the number of times the keystroke is repeated as a result of the user holding down the key..|  \n|16-23|Specifies the scan code. The value depends on the original equipment manufacturer (OEM)|  \n|24|Specifies whether the key is an extended key, such as the right-hand ALT and CTRL keys that appear on an enhanced 101- or 102-key keyboard. The value is 1 if it is an extended key; otherwise, it is 0.|  \n|25-28|Used internally by Windows.|  \n|29|Specifies the context code. The value is 1 if the ALT key is held down while the key is pressed; otherwise, the value is 0.|  \n|30|Specifies the previous key state. The value is 1 if the key is down before the message is sent, or it is 0 if the key is up.|  \n|31|Specifies the transition state. The value is 1 if the key is being released, or it is 0 if the key is being pressed.|  \n  \n### Remarks  \n It specifies the virtual key code of the Control-menu key. (For a list of of standard virtual key codes, see Winuser.h)  \n  \n When the context code is 0, `WM_SYSCHAR` can pass the [WM_SYSCHAR](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms646357) message to the [TranslateAccelerator](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms646373) Windows function, which will handle it as though it were a normal key message instead of a system character-key. This allows accelerator keys to be used with the active window even if the active window does not have the input focus.  \n  \n For IBM Enhanced 101- and 102-key keyboards, enhanced keys are the right ALT and the right CTRL keys on the main section of the keyboard; the INS, DEL, HOME, END, PAGE UP, PAGE DOWN, and arrow keys in the clusters to the left of the numeric keypad; and the slash (/) and ENTER keys in the numeric keypad. Some other keyboards may support the extended-key bit in `nFlags`.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  This member function is called by the framework to allow your application to handle a Windows message. The parameters passed to your function reflect the parameters received by the framework when the message was received. If you call the base-class implementation of this function, that implementation will use the parameters originally passed with the message and not the parameters you supply to the function.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__onsyscolorchange\"></a>  CWnd::OnSysColorChange  \n The framework calls this member function for all top-level windows when a change is made in the system color setting.  \n  \n```  \nafx_msg void OnSysColorChange();\n```  \n  \n### Remarks  \n Windows calls `OnSysColorChange` for any window that is affected by a system color change.  \n  \n Applications that have brushes that use the existing system colors should delete those brushes and re-create them with the new system colors.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__onsyscommand\"></a>  CWnd::OnSysCommand  \n The framework calls this member function when the user selects a command from the Control menu, or when the user selects the Maximize or the Minimize button.  \n  \n```  \nafx_msg void OnSysCommand(\n    UINT nID,  \n    LPARAM lParam);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `nID`  \n Specifies the type of system command requested. This parameter can be any one of the following values:  \n  \n- **SC_CLOSE** Close the `CWnd` object.  \n  \n- **SC_HOTKEY** Activate the `CWnd` object associated with the application-specified hot key. The low-order word of `lParam` identifies the `HWND` of the window to activate.  \n  \n- **SC_HSCROLL** Scroll horizontally.  \n  \n- **SC_KEYMENU** Retrieve a menu through a keystroke.  \n  \n- **SC_MAXIMIZE** (or **SC_ZOOM**)   Maximize the `CWnd` object.  \n  \n- **SC_MINIMIZE** (or **SC_ICON**)   Minimize the `CWnd` object.  \n  \n- **SC_MOUSEMENU** Retrieve a menu through a mouse click.  \n  \n- **SC_MOVE** Move the `CWnd` object.  \n  \n- **SC_NEXTWINDOW** Move to the next window.  \n  \n- **SC_PREVWINDOW** Move to the previous window.  \n  \n- **SC_RESTORE** Restore window to normal position and size.  \n  \n- **SC_SCREENSAVE** Executes the screen-saver application specified in the [boot] section of the SYSTEM.INI file.  \n  \n- **SC_SIZE** Size the `CWnd` object.  \n  \n- **SC_TASKLIST** Execute or activate the Windows Task Manager application.  \n  \n- **SC_VSCROLL** Scroll vertically.  \n  \n `lParam`  \n If a Control-menu command is chosen with the mouse, `lParam` contains the cursor coordinates. The low-order word contains the x coordinate, and the high-order word contains the y coordinate. Otherwise this parameter is not used.  \n  \n- **SC_HOTKEY** Activate the window associated with the application-specified hot key. The low-order word of `lParam` identifies the window to activate.  \n  \n- **SC_SCREENSAVE** Execute the screen-save application specified in the Desktop section of Control Panel.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n By default, `OnSysCommand` carries out the Control-menu request for the predefined actions specified in the preceding table.  \n  \n In `WM_SYSCOMMAND` messages, the four low-order bits of the `nID` parameter are used internally by Windows. When an application tests the value of `nID`, it must combine the value 0xFFF0 with the `nID` value by using the bitwise-AND operator to obtain the correct result.  \n  \n The menu items in a Control menu can be modified with the `GetSystemMenu`, `AppendMenu`, `InsertMenu`, and `ModifyMenu` member functions. Applications that modify the Control menu must process `WM_SYSCOMMAND` messages, and any `WM_SYSCOMMAND` messages not handled by the application must be passed on to `OnSysCommand`. Any command values added by an application must be processed by the application and cannot be passed to `OnSysCommand`.  \n  \n An application can carry out any system command at any time by passing a `WM_SYSCOMMAND` message to `OnSysCommand`.  \n  \n Accelerator (shortcut) keystrokes that are defined to select items from the Control menu are translated into `OnSysCommand` calls; all other accelerator keystrokes are translated into [WM_COMMAND](#cwnd__oncommand) messages.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  This member function is called by the framework to allow your application to handle a Windows message.

For a list of of standard virtual key codes, see Winuser.h  \n  \n `nRepCnt`  \n Specifies the repeat count.  \n  \n `nFlags`  \n Specifies the scan code, key-transition code, previous key state, and context code, as shown in the following list:  \n  \n|Value|Meaning|  \n|-----------|-------------|  \n|0–7|Scan code (OEM-dependent value). Low byte of high-order word.|  \n|8|Extended key, such as a function key or a key on the numeric keypad (1 if it is an extended key; otherwise 0).|  \n|9–10|Not used.|  \n|11–12|Used internally by Windows.|  \n|13|Context code (1 if the ALT key is held down while the key is pressed, 0 otherwise).|  \n|14|Previous key state (1 if the key is down before the message is sent, 0 if the key is up).|  \n|15|Transition state (1 if the key is being released, 0 if the key is being pressed).|  \n  \n For `OnSysKeyDown` calls, the key-transition bit (bit 15) is 0. The context-code bit (bit 13) is 1 if the ALT key is down while the key is pressed; it is 0 if the message is sent to the active window because no window has the input focus.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n If no window currently has the input focus, the active window's `OnSysKeyDown` member function is called. The `CWnd` object that receives the message can distinguish between these two contexts by checking the context code in `nFlags`.  \n  \n When the context code is 0, the `WM_SYSKEYDOWN` message received by `OnSysKeyDown` can be passed to the [TranslateAccelerator](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms646373) Windows function, which will handle it as though it were a normal key message instead of a system-key message. This allows accelerator keys to be used with the active window even if the active window does not have the input focus.  \n  \n Because of auto-repeat, more than one `OnSysKeyDown` call may occur before the [WM_SYSKEYUP](#cwnd__onsyskeyup) message is received. The previous key state (bit 14) can be used to determine whether the `OnSysKeyDown` call indicates the first down transition or a repeated down transition.  \n  \n For IBM Enhanced 101- and 102-key keyboards, enhanced keys are the right ALT and the right CTRL keys on the main section of the keyboard; the INS, DEL, HOME, END, PAGE UP, PAGE DOWN, and arrow keys in the clusters to the left of the numeric keypad; and the slash (/) and ENTER keys in the numeric keypad. Some other keyboards may support the extended-key bit in `nFlags`.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  This member function is called by the framework to allow your application to handle a Windows message.

For a list of of standard virtual key codes, see Winuser.h  \n  \n `nRepCnt`  \n Specifies the repeat count.  \n  \n `nFlags`  \n Specifies the scan code, key-transition code, previous key state, and context code, as shown in the following list:  \n  \n|Value|Meaning|  \n|-----------|-------------|  \n|0–7|Scan code (OEM-dependent value). Low byte of high-order word.|  \n|8|Extended key, such as a function key or a key on the numeric keypad (1 if it is an extended key; otherwise 0).|  \n|9–10|Not used.|  \n|11–12|Used internally by Windows.|  \n|13|Context code (1 if the ALT key is held down while the key is pressed, 0 otherwise).|  \n|14|Previous key state (1 if the key is down before the message is sent, 0 if the key is up).|  \n|15|Transition state (1 if the key is being released, 0 if the key is being pressed).|  \n  \n For `OnSysKeyUp` calls, the key-transition bit (bit 15) is 1. The context-code bit (bit 13) is 1 if the ALT key is down while the key is pressed; it is 0 if the message is sent to the active window because no window has the input focus.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n If no window currently has the input focus, the active window's `OnSysKeyUp` member function is called. The `CWnd` object that receives the call can distinguish between these two contexts by checking the context code in `nFlags`.  \n  \n When the context code is 0, the `WM_SYSKEYUP` message received by `OnSysKeyUp` can be passed to the [TranslateAccelerator](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms646373) Windows function, which will handle it as though it were a normal key message instead of a system-key message.

Otherwise, this parameter is zero.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n This function is called only when an application has initiated a training card with Windows Help. An application initiates a training card by specifying the **HELP_TCARD** command in a call to the [WinHelp](../../mfc/reference/cwinapp-class.md#cwinapp__winhelp) function.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__ontimechange\"></a>  CWnd::OnTimeChange  \n The framework calls this member function after the system time is changed.  \n  \n```  \nafx_msg void OnTimeChange();\n```  \n  \n### Remarks  \n Have any application that changes the system time send this message to all top-level windows. To send the `WM_TIMECHANGE` message to all top-level windows, an application can use the [SendMessage](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms644950) Windows function with its *hwnd* parameter set to **HWND_BROADCAST**.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__ontimer\"></a>  CWnd::OnTimer  \n The framework calls this member function after each interval specified in the [SetTimer](#cwnd__settimer) member function used to install a timer.  \n  \n```  \nafx_msg void OnTimer(UINT_PTR nIDEvent);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `nIDEvent`  \n Specifies the identifier of the timer.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The [DispatchMessage](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms644934) Windows function sends a [WM_TIMER](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms644902) message when no other messages are in the application's message queue.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  This member function is called by the framework to allow your application to handle a Windows message.

For a list of of standard virtual key codes, see Winuser.h  \n  \n `pListBox`  \n Specifies a pointer to the list box. The pointer may be temporary and should not be stored for later use.  \n  \n `nIndex`  \n Specifies the current caret position.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Specifies the action that the application performed in response to the message. A return value of –2 indicates that the application handled all aspects of selecting the item and requires no further action by the list box. A return value of –1 indicates that the list box should perform the default action in response to the keystroke. A return value of 0 or greater specifies the zero-based index of an item in the list box and indicates that the list box should perform the default action for the keystroke on the given item.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n This member function is called by the framework only for list boxes that have the [LBS_HASSTRINGS](../../mfc/reference/list-box-styles.md) style.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  This member function is called by the framework to allow your application to handle a Windows message.

This parameter can be one of the following:  \n  \n- **SB_BOTTOM** Scroll to bottom.  \n  \n- **SB_ENDSCROLL** End scroll.  \n  \n- **SB_LINEDOWN** Scroll one line down.  \n  \n- **SB_LINEUP** Scroll one line up.  \n  \n- **SB_PAGEDOWN** Scroll one page down.  \n  \n- **SB_PAGEUP** Scroll one page up.  \n  \n- **SB_THUMBPOSITION** Scroll to the absolute position. The current position is provided in `nPos`.  \n  \n- **SB_THUMBTRACK** Drag scroll box to specified position. The current position is provided in `nPos`.  \n  \n- **SB_TOP** Scroll to top.  \n  \n `nPos`  \n Contains the current scroll-box position if the scroll-bar code is **SB_THUMBPOSITION** or **SB_THUMBTRACK**; otherwise not used. Depending on the initial scroll range, `nPos` may be negative and should be cast to an `int` if necessary.  \n  \n `pScrollBar`  \n If the scroll message came from a scroll-bar control, contains a pointer to the control. If the user clicked a window's scroll bar, this parameter is **NULL**. The pointer may be temporary and should not be stored for later use.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n `OnVScroll` typically is used by applications that give some feedback while the scroll box is being dragged.  \n  \n If `OnVScroll` scrolls the contents of the `CWnd` object, it must also reset the position of the scroll box with the [SetScrollPos](#cwnd__setscrollpos) member function.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  This member function is called by the framework to allow your application to handle a Windows message.

(The string does not include the square brackets that enclose the section name.)  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The [SystemParametersInfo](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms724947) Windows function calls `OnWinIniChange` after an application uses the function to change a setting in the WIN.INI file.  \n  \n To send the `WM_WININICHANGE` message to all top-level windows, an application can use the [SendMessage](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms644950) Windows function with its *hwnd* parameter set to **HWND_BROADCAST**.  \n  \n If an application changes many different sections in WIN.INI at the same time, the application should send one `WM_WININICHANGE` message with `lpszSection` set to **NULL**. Otherwise, an application should send `WM_WININICHANGE` each time it makes a change to WIN.INI.  \n  \n If an application receives an `OnWinIniChange` call with `lpszSection` set to **NULL**, the application should check all sections in WIN.INI that affect the application.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  This member function is called by the framework to allow your application to handle a Windows message.

The **RDW_INVALIDATE** flag must also be specified; otherwise **RDW_ERASE** has no effect.  \n  \n- **RDW_FRAME** Causes any part of the nonclient area of the window that intersects the update region to receive a [WM_NCPAINT](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd145212) message. The **RDW_INVALIDATE** flag must also be specified; otherwise **RDW_FRAME** has no effect.  \n  \n- **RDW_INTERNALPAINT** Causes a [WM_PAINT](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd145213) message to be posted to the window regardless of whether the window contains an invalid region.  \n  \n- **RDW_INVALIDATE** Invalidate `lpRectUpdate` or *prgnUpdate* (only one may be not **NULL**). If both are **NULL**, the entire window is invalidated.  \n  \n The following flags are used to validate the window:  \n  \n- **RDW_NOERASE** Suppresses any pending `WM_ERASEBKGND` messages.  \n  \n- **RDW_NOFRAME** Suppresses any pending `WM_NCPAINT` messages. This flag must be used with **RDW_VALIDATE** and is typically used with **RDW_NOCHILDREN**. This option should be used with care, as it could prevent parts of a window from painting properly.  \n  \n- **RDW_NOINTERNALPAINT** Suppresses any pending internal `WM_PAINT` messages. This flag does not affect `WM_PAINT` messages resulting from invalid areas.  \n  \n- **RDW_VALIDATE** Validates `lpRectUpdate` or *prgnUpdate* (only one may be not **NULL**). If both are **NULL**, the entire window is validated. This flag does not affect internal `WM_PAINT` messages.  \n  \n The following flags control when repainting occurs. Painting is not performed by the `RedrawWindow` function unless one of these bits is specified.  \n  \n- **RDW_ERASENOW** Causes the affected windows (as specified by the **RDW_ALLCHILDREN** and **RDW_NOCHILDREN** flags) to receive `WM_NCPAINT` and `WM_ERASEBKGND` messages, if necessary, before the function returns. `WM_PAINT` messages are deferred.  \n  \n- **RDW_UPDATENOW** Causes the affected windows (as specified by the **RDW_ALLCHILDREN** and **RDW_NOCHILDREN** flags) to receive `WM_NCPAINT`, `WM_ERASEBKGND`, and `WM_PAINT` messages, if necessary, before the function returns.  \n  \n By default, the windows affected by the `RedrawWindow` function depend on whether the specified window has the **WS_CLIPCHILDREN** style. The child windows of **WS_CLIPCHILDREN** windows are not affected. However, those windows that are not **WS_CLIPCHILDREN** windows are recursively validated or invalidated until a **WS_CLIPCHILDREN** window is encountered. The following flags control which windows are affected by the `RedrawWindow` function:  \n  \n- **RDW_ALLCHILDREN** Includes child windows, if any, in the repainting operation.  \n  \n- **RDW_NOCHILDREN** Excludes child windows, if any, from the repainting operation.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Nonzero if the window was redrawn successfully; otherwise 0.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n When the `RedrawWindow` member function is used to invalidate part of the desktop window, that window does not receive a [WM_PAINT](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd145213) message. To repaint the desktop, an application should use [CWnd::ValidateRgn](#cwnd__validatergn), [CWnd::InvalidateRgn](#cwnd__invalidatergn), [CWnd::UpdateWindow](#cwnd__updatewindow), or [RedrawWindow](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd162911)  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__reflectchildnotify\"></a>  CWnd::ReflectChildNotify  \n This message function is called by the framework from [OnChildNotify](#cwnd__onchildnotify).  \n  \n```  \nBOOL ReflectChildNotify(\n    UINT message,  \n    WPARAM wParam,  \n    LPARAM lParam,  \n    LRESULT* pResult);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `message`  \n Specifies the message to be reflected.  \n  \n `wParam`  \n Specifies additional message-dependent information.  \n  \n `lParam`  \n Specifies additional message-dependent information.  \n  \n `pResult`  \n The result generated by the child window to be returned by the parent window. Can be **NULL**.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n **TRUE** if message was reflected; otherwise **FALSE**.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n It is a helper function which reflects `message` to its source.  \n  \n Reflected messages are sent directly to [CWnd::OnWndMsg](#cwnd__onwndmsg) or [CCmdTarget::OnCmdMsg](../../mfc/reference/ccmdtarget-class.md#ccmdtarget__oncmdmsg).  \n  \n For more information about message reflection, see [Handling Reflected Messages](../../mfc/handling-reflected-messages.md).  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__reflectlastmsg\"></a>  CWnd::ReflectLastMsg  \n This member function is called by the framework to reflect the last message to the child window.  \n  \n```  \nstatic BOOL PASCAL ReflectLastMsg(\n    HWND hWndChild,  \n    LRESULT* pResult = NULL);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `hWndChild`  \n A handle to a child window.  \n  \n `pResult`  \n The result generated by the child window to be returned by the parent window. Can be **NULL**.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Nonzero if the message was handled; otherwise 0.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n This member function calls [SendChildNotifyLastMsg](#cwnd__sendchildnotifylastmsg) if the window identified by `hWndChild` is an OLE control or a window in the permanent map.  \n  \n For more information about message reflection, see [Handling Reflected Messages](../../mfc/handling-reflected-messages.md).  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__releasedc\"></a>  CWnd::ReleaseDC  \n Releases a device context, freeing it for use by other applications.  \n  \n```  \nint ReleaseDC(CDC* pDC);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `pDC`  \n Identifies the device context to be released.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Nonzero if successful; otherwise 0.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The effect of the `ReleaseDC` member function depends on the device-context type.  \n  \n The application must call the `ReleaseDC` member function for each call to the [GetWindowDC](#cwnd__getwindowdc) member function and for each call to the [GetDC](#cwnd__getdc) member function.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__repositionbars\"></a>  CWnd::RepositionBars  \n Called to reposition and resize control bars in the client area of a window.  \n  \n```  \nvoid RepositionBars(UINT nIDFirst,\n    UINT nIDLast,\n    UINT nIDLeftOver,\n    UINT nFlag = reposDefault,\n    LPRECT lpRectParam = NULL,\n    LPCRECT lpRectClient = NULL,\n    BOOL bStretch = TRUE) ;  \n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `nIDFirst`  \n The ID of the first in a range of control bars to reposition and resize.  \n  \n `nIDLast`  \n The ID of the last in a range of control bars to reposition and resize.  \n  \n `nIDLeftOver`  \n Specifies ID of pane that fills the rest of the client area.  \n  \n `nFlag`  \n Can have one of the following values:  \n  \n- **CWnd::reposDefault** Performs the layout of the control bars. `lpRectParam` is not used and can be **NULL**.  \n  \n- **CWnd::reposQuery** The layout of the control bars is not done; instead `lpRectParam` is initialized with the size of the client area, as if the layout had actually been done.  \n  \n- **CWnd::reposExtra** Adds the values of `lpRectParam` to the client area of `nIDLast` and also performs the layout *.*  \n  \n `lpRectParam`  \n Points to a [RECT structure](../../mfc/reference/rect-structure1.md); the usage of which depends on the value of `nFlag`.  \n  \n *lpRectClient*  \n Points to a [RECT structure](../../mfc/reference/rect-structure1.md) containing the available client area. If **NULL**, the window's client area will be used.  \n  \n `bStretch`  \n Indicates whether the bar should be stretched to the size of the frame.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The `nIDFirst` and `nIDLast` parameters define a range of control-bar IDs to be repositioned in the client area. The `nIDLeftOver` parameter specifies the ID of the child window (normally the view) which is repositioned and resized to fill the rest of the client area not filled by control bars.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__runmodalloop\"></a>  CWnd::RunModalLoop  \n Call this member function to retrieve, translate, or dispatch messages until [ContinueModal](#cwnd__continuemodal) returns **FALSE**.  \n  \n```  \nint RunModalLoop(DWORD dwFlags = 0);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `dwFlags`  \n Specifies the Windows message to be sent. Can be one of the following values:  \n  \n- **MLF_NOIDLEMSG** Don't send [WM_ENTERIDLE](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms645422) messages to the parent.  \n  \n- **MLF_NOKICKIDLE** Don't send **WM_KICKIDLE** messages to the window.  \n  \n- **MLF_SHOWONIDLE** Show the window when message queue goes idle.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Specifies the value of the `nResult` parameter passed to the [EndModalLoop](#cwnd__endmodalloop) member function, which is then used to end the modal loop.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n By default, `ContinueModal` returns **FALSE** after `EndModalLoop` is called. Returns the value provided as `nResult` to `EndModalLoop`.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__screentoclient\"></a>  CWnd::ScreenToClient  \n Converts the screen coordinates of a given point or rectangle on the display to client coordinates.  \n  \n```  \nvoid ScreenToClient(LPPOINT lpPoint) const;\n\n \n \nvoid ScreenToClient(LPRECT lpRect) const;\n\n \n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `lpPoint`  \n Points to a [CPoint](../../atl-mfc-shared/reference/cpoint-class.md) object or [POINT structure](../../mfc/reference/point-structure1.md) that contains the screen coordinates to be converted.  \n  \n `lpRect`  \n Points to a [CRect](../../atl-mfc-shared/reference/crect-class.md) object or [RECT structure](../../mfc/reference/rect-structure1.md) that contains the screen coordinates to be converted.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The `ScreenToClient` member function replaces the screen coordinates given in `lpPoint` or `lpRect` with client coordinates. The new coordinates are relative to the upper-left corner of the `CWnd` client area.  \n  \n### Example  \n  See the example for [CListCtrl::GetItemRect](../../mfc/reference/clistctrl-class.md#clistctrl__getitemrect).  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__scrollwindow\"></a>  CWnd::ScrollWindow  \n Scrolls the contents of the client area of the current `CWnd` object.  \n  \n```  \nvoid ScrollWindow(\n    int xAmount,  \n    int yAmount,  \n    LPCRECT lpRect = NULL,  \n    LPCRECT lpClipRect = NULL);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `xAmount`  \n Specifies the amount, in device units, of horizontal scrolling. This parameter must be a negative value to scroll to the left.  \n  \n `yAmount`  \n Specifies the amount, in device units, of vertical scrolling. This parameter must be a negative value to scroll up.  \n  \n `lpRect`  \n Points to a [CRect](../../atl-mfc-shared/reference/crect-class.md) object or [RECT structure](../../mfc/reference/rect-structure1.md) that specifies the portion of the client area to be scrolled. If `lpRect` is **NULL**, the entire client area is scrolled. The caret is repositioned if the cursor rectangle intersects the scroll rectangle.  \n  \n `lpClipRect`  \n Points to a `CRect` object or `RECT` structure that specifies the clipping rectangle to scroll. Only bits inside this rectangle are scrolled. Bits outside this rectangle are not affected even if they are in the `lpRect` rectangle. If `lpClipRect` is **NULL**, no clipping is performed on the scroll rectangle.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n If the caret is in the `CWnd` being scrolled, `ScrollWindow` automatically hides the caret to prevent it from being erased and then restores the caret after the scroll is finished. The caret position is adjusted accordingly.  \n  \n The area uncovered by the `ScrollWindow` member function is not repainted but is combined into the current `CWnd` object's update region. The application will eventually receive a [WM_PAINT](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd145213) message notifying it that the region needs repainting. To repaint the uncovered area at the same time the scrolling is done, call the [UpdateWindow](#cwnd__updatewindow) member function immediately after calling `ScrollWindow`.  \n  \n If `lpRect` is **NULL**, the positions of any child windows in the window are offset by the amount specified by `xAmount` and `yAmount`, and any invalid (unpainted) areas in the `CWnd` are also offset. `ScrollWindow` is faster when `lpRect` is **NULL**.  \n  \n If `lpRect` is not **NULL**, the positions of child windows are not changed, and invalid areas in `CWnd` are not offset. To prevent updating problems when `lpRect` is not **NULL**, call the `UpdateWindow` member function to repaint `CWnd` before calling `ScrollWindow`.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__scrollwindowex\"></a>  CWnd::ScrollWindowEx  \n Scrolls the contents of a window's client area.  \n  \n```  \nint ScrollWindowEx(\n    int dx,  \n    int dy,  \n    LPCRECT lpRectScroll,  \n    LPCRECT lpRectClip,  \n    CRgn* prgnUpdate,  \n    LPRECT lpRectUpdate,  \n    UINT flags);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `dx`  \n Specifies the amount, in device units, of horizontal scrolling. This parameter must have a negative value to scroll to the left.  \n  \n *dy*  \n Specifies the amount, in device units, of vertical scrolling. This parameter must have a negative value to scroll up.  \n  \n `lpRectScroll`  \n Points to a [RECT structure](../../mfc/reference/rect-structure1.md) that specifies the portion of the client area to be scrolled. If this parameter is **NULL**, the entire client area is scrolled.  \n  \n `lpRectClip`  \n Points to a `RECT` structure that specifies the clipping rectangle to scroll. This structure takes precedence over the rectangle pointed to by `lpRectScroll`. Only bits inside this rectangle are scrolled. Bits outside this rectangle are not affected even if they are in the `lpRectScroll` rectangle. If this parameter is **NULL**, no clipping is performed on the scroll rectangle.  \n  \n *prgnUpdate*  \n Identifies the region that is modified to hold the region invalidated by scrolling. This parameter may be **NULL**.  \n  \n `lpRectUpdate`  \n Points to a `RECT` structure that will receive the boundaries of the rectangle invalidated by scrolling. This parameter may be **NULL**.  \n  \n `flags`  \n Can have one of the following values:  \n  \n- **SW_ERASE** When specified with **SW_INVALIDATE**, erases the newly invalidated region by sending a [WM_ERASEBKGND](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms648055) message to the window.  \n  \n- **SW_INVALIDATE** Invalidates the region identified by *prgnUpdate* after scrolling.  \n  \n- **SW_SCROLLCHILDREN** Scrolls all child windows that intersect the rectangle pointed to by `lpRectScroll` by the number of pixels specified in `dx` and *dy*. Windows sends a [WM_MOVE](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms632631) message to all child windows that intersect `lpRectScroll`, even if they do not move. The caret is repositioned when a child window is scrolled and the cursor rectangle intersects the scroll rectangle.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n The return value is **SIMPLEREGION** (rectangular invalidated region), **COMPLEXREGION** (nonrectangular invalidated region; overlapping rectangles), or **NULLREGION** (no invalidated region), if the function is successful; otherwise the return value is **ERROR**.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n This function is similar to the [ScrollWindow](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb787591) function, with some additional features.  \n  \n If [SW_INVALIDATE](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb787593) and [SW_ERASE](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb787593) are not specified, the `ScrollWindowEx` member function does not invalidate the area that is scrolled away from. If either of these flags is set, `ScrollWindowEx` invalidates this area. The area is not updated until the application calls the [UpdateWindow](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd145167) member function, calls the [RedrawWindow](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd162911) member function (specifying [RDW_UPDATENOW](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd162911) or [RDW_ERASENOW](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd162911)), or retrieves the [WM_PAINT](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd145213) message from the application queue.  \n  \n If the window has the [WS_CLIPCHILDREN](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms632679) style, the returned areas specified by *prgnUpdate* and `lpRectUpdate` represent the total area of the scrolled window that must be updated, including any areas in child windows that need updating.  \n  \n If the [SW_SCROLLCHILDREN](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb787593) flag is specified, Windows will not properly update the screen if part of a child window is scrolled. The part of the scrolled child window that lies outside the source rectangle will not be erased and will not be redrawn properly in its new destination. Use the [DeferWindowPos](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms632681) Windows function to move child windows that do not lie completely within the `lpRectScroll` rectangle. The cursor is repositioned if the **SW_SCROLLCHILDREN** flag is set and the caret rectangle intersects the scroll rectangle.  \n  \n All input and output coordinates (for `lpRectScroll`, `lpRectClip`, `lpRectUpdate`, and *prgnUpdate*) are assumed to be in client coordinates, regardless of whether the window has the **CS_OWNDC** or **CS_CLASSDC** class style. Use the [LPtoDP](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd145042) and [DPtoLP](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd162474) Windows functions to convert to and from logical coordinates, if necessary.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__sendchildnotifylastmsg\"></a>  CWnd::SendChildNotifyLastMsg  \n This member function is called by the framework to provide a notification message to a child window, from the parent window, so the child window can handle a task.  \n  \n```  \nBOOL SendChildNotifyLastMsg(LRESULT* pResult = NULL);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `pResult`  \n The result generated by the child window to be returned by the parent window.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Nonzero if the child window has handled the message sent to its parent; otherwise 0.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n `SendChildNotifyLastMsg` send the current message to the source if it is a message that is reflected.  \n  \n For more information about message reflection, see [Handling Reflected Messages](../../mfc/handling-reflected-messages.md).  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__senddlgitemmessage\"></a>  CWnd::SendDlgItemMessage  \n Sends a message to a control.  \n  \n```  \nLRESULT SendDlgItemMessage(\n    int nID,  \n    UINT message,  \n    WPARAM wParam = 0,  \n    LPARAM lParam = 0);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `nID`  \n Specifies the identifier of the dialog control that will receive the message.  \n  \n `message`  \n Specifies the message to be sent.  \n  \n `wParam`  \n Specifies additional message-dependent information.  \n  \n `lParam`  \n Specifies additional message-dependent information.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Specifies the value returned by the control's window procedure, or 0 if the control was not found.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The `SendDlgItemMessage` member function does not return until the message has been processed.  \n  \n Using `SendDlgItemMessage` is identical to obtaining a `CWnd`* to the given control and calling the [SendMessage](#cwnd__sendmessage) member function.  \n  \n### Example  \n [!code-cpp[NVC_MFCWindowing#113](../../mfc/reference/codesnippet/cpp/cwnd-class_54.cpp)]  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__sendmessage\"></a>  CWnd::SendMessage  \n Sends the specified message to this window.  \n  \n```  \nLRESULT SendMessage(\n    UINT message,  \n    WPARAM wParam = 0,  \n    LPARAM lParam = 0);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `message`  \n Specifies the message to be sent.  \n  \n `wParam`  \n Specifies additional message-dependent information.  \n  \n `lParam`  \n Specifies additional message-dependent information.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n The result of the message processing; its value depends on the message sent.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The **SendMessage** member function calls the window procedure directly and does not return until that window procedure has processed the message. This is in contrast to the [PostMessage](#cwnd__postmessage) member function, which places the message into the window's message queue and returns immediately.  \n  \n### Example  \n [!code-cpp[NVC_MFCWindowing#101](../../mfc/reference/codesnippet/cpp/cwnd-class_41.cpp)]  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__sendmessagetodescendants\"></a>  CWnd::SendMessageToDescendants  \n Call this member function to send the specified Windows message to all descendant windows.  \n  \n```  \nvoid SendMessageToDescendants(\n    UINT message,  \n    WPARAM wParam = 0,  \n    LPARAM lParam = 0,  \n    BOOL bDeep = TRUE,  \n    BOOL bOnlyPerm = FALSE);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `message`  \n Specifies the message to be sent.  \n  \n `wParam`  \n Specifies additional message-dependent information.  \n  \n `lParam`  \n Specifies additional message-dependent information.  \n  \n `bDeep`  \n Specifies the level to which to search. If **TRUE**, recursively search all children; if **FALSE**, search only immediate children.  \n  \n `bOnlyPerm`  \n Specifies whether the message will be received by temporary windows. If **TRUE**, temporary windows can receive the message; if **FALSE**, only permanent windows receive the message. For more information on temporary windows see [Technical Note 3](../../mfc/tn003-mapping-of-windows-handles-to-objects.md).  \n  \n### Remarks  \n If `bDeep` is **FALSE**, the message is sent just to the immediate children of the window; otherwise the message is sent to all descendant windows.  \n  \n If `bDeep` and `bOnlyPerm` are **TRUE**, the search continues below temporary windows. In this case, only permanent windows encountered during the search receive the message. If `bDeep` is **FALSE**, the message is sent only to the immediate children of the window.  \n  \n### Example  \n [!code-cpp[NVC_MFCWindowing#114](../../mfc/reference/codesnippet/cpp/cwnd-class_55.cpp)]  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__sendnotifymessage\"></a>  CWnd::SendNotifyMessage  \n Sends the specified message to the window.  \n  \n```  \nBOOL SendNotifyMessage(\n    UINT message,  \n    WPARAM wParam,  \n    LPARAM lParam);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `message`  \n Specifies the message to be sent.  \n  \n `wParam`  \n Specifies additional message-dependent information.  \n  \n `lParam`  \n Specifies additional message-dependent information.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Nonzero if the function is successful; otherwise 0.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n If the window was created by the calling thread, `SendNotifyMessage` calls the window procedure for the window and does not return until the window procedure has processed the message. If the window was created by a different thread, `SendNotifyMessage` passes the message to the window procedure and returns immediately; it does not wait for the window procedure to finish processing the message.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__setactivewindow\"></a>  CWnd::SetActiveWindow  \n Makes `CWnd` the active window.  \n  \n```  \nCWnd* SetActiveWindow();\n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n The window that was previously active.  \n  \n The returned pointer may be temporary and should not be stored for later use.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The `SetActiveWindow` member function should be used with care since it allows an application to arbitrarily take over the active window and input focus. Normally, Windows takes care of all activation.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__setcapture\"></a>  CWnd::SetCapture  \n Causes all subsequent mouse input to be sent to the current `CWnd` object regardless of the position of the cursor.  \n  \n```  \nCWnd* SetCapture();\n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n A pointer to the window object that previously received all mouse input. It is `NULL` if there is no such window. The returned pointer may be temporary and should not be stored for later use.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n When `CWnd` no longer requires all mouse input, the application should call the [ReleaseCapture](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms646261) function so that other windows can receive mouse input.  \n  \n While mouse input is captured, no `WM_NCHITTEST` or `WM_SETCURSOR` messages are sent to the active window.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__setcaretpos\"></a>  CWnd::SetCaretPos  \n Sets the position of the caret.  \n  \n```  \nstatic void PASCAL SetCaretPos(POINT point);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `point`  \n Specifies the new x and y coordinates (in client coordinates) of the caret.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The `SetCaretPos` member function moves the caret only if it is owned by a window in the current task. `SetCaretPos` moves the caret whether or not the caret is hidden.  \n  \n The caret is a shared resource. A window should not move the caret if it does not own the caret.  \n  \n### Example  \n [!code-cpp[NVC_MFCWindowing#115](../../mfc/reference/codesnippet/cpp/cwnd-class_56.cpp)]  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__setclipboardviewer\"></a>  CWnd::SetClipboardViewer  \n Adds this window to the chain of windows that are notified (by means of the `WM_DRAWCLIPBOARD` message) whenever the content of the Clipboard is changed.  \n  \n```  \nHWND SetClipboardViewer();\n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n A handle to the next window in the Clipboard-viewer chain if successful. Applications should save this handle (it can be stored as a member variable) and use it when responding to Clipboard-viewer chain messages.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n A window that is part of the Clipboard-viewer chain must respond to [WM_DRAWCLIPBOARD](#cwnd__ondrawclipboard), [WM_CHANGECBCHAIN](#cwnd__onchangecbchain), and [WM_DESTROY](#cwnd__ondestroy) messages and pass the message to the next window in the chain.  \n  \n This member function sends a `WM_DRAWCLIPBOARD` message to the window. Since the handle to the next window in the Clipboard-viewer chain has not yet been returned, the application should not pass on the `WM_DRAWCLIPBOARD` message that it receives during the call to `SetClipboardViewer`.  \n  \n To remove itself from the Clipboard-viewer chain, an application must call the [ChangeClipboardChain](#cwnd__changeclipboardchain) member function.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__setdlgctrlid\"></a>  CWnd::SetDlgCtrlID  \n Sets the window ID or control ID for the window to a new value.  \n  \n```  \nint SetDlgCtrlID(int nID);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `nID`  \n The new value to set for the control's identifier.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n The previous identifier of the window, if successful; otherwise 0.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The window can be any child window, not only a control in a dialog box. The window cannot be a top-level window.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__setdlgitemint\"></a>  CWnd::SetDlgItemInt  \n Sets the text of a given control in a dialog box to the string representation of a specified integer value.  \n  \n```  \nvoid SetDlgItemInt(\n    int nID,  \n    UINT nValue,  \n    BOOL bSigned = TRUE);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `nID`  \n Specifies the integer ID of the control to be changed.  \n  \n `nValue`  \n Specifies the integer value used to generate the item text.  \n  \n `bSigned`  \n Specifies whether the integer value is signed or unsigned. If this parameter is **TRUE**, `nValue` is signed. If this parameter is **TRUE** and `nValue` is less than 0, a minus sign is placed before the first digit in the string. If this parameter is **FALSE**, `nValue` is unsigned.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n `SetDlgItemInt` sends a [WM_SETTEXT](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms632644) message to the given control.  \n  \n### Example  \n  See the example for [CWnd::SetDlgItemText](#cwnd__setdlgitemtext).  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__setdlgitemtext\"></a>  CWnd::SetDlgItemText  \n Sets the caption or text of a control owned by a window or dialog box.  \n  \n```  \nvoid SetDlgItemText(\n    int nID,  \n    LPCTSTR lpszString);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `nID`  \n Identifies the control whose text is to be set.  \n  \n `lpszString`  \n Points to a [CString](../../atl-mfc-shared/reference/cstringt-class.md) object or null-terminated string that contains the text to be copied to the control.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n `SetDlgItemText` sends a [WM_SETTEXT](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms632644) message to the given control.  \n  \n### Example  \n [!code-cpp[NVC_MFCWindowing#116](../../mfc/reference/codesnippet/cpp/cwnd-class_57.cpp)]  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__setforegroundwindow\"></a>  CWnd::SetForegroundWindow  \n Puts the thread that created the window into the foreground and activates the window.  \n  \n```  \nBOOL SetForegroundWindow();\n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Nonzero if the function is successful; otherwise 0.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n Keyboard input is directed to the window, and various visual cues are changed for the user. The foreground window is the window with which the user is currently working. The foreground window applies only to top-level windows (frame windows or dialogs boxes).  \n  \n### Example  \n  See the example for [CWnd::FindWindow](#cwnd__findwindow).  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__setfocus\"></a>  CWnd::SetFocus  \n Claims the input focus.  \n  \n```  \nCWnd* SetFocus();\n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n A pointer to the window object that previously had the input focus. It is **NULL** if there is no such window. The returned pointer may be temporary and should not be stored.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The input focus directs all subsequent keyboard input to this window. Any window that previously had the input focus loses it.  \n  \n The `SetFocus` member function sends a [WM_KILLFOCUS](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms646282) message to the window that loses the input focus and a [WM_SETFOCUS](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms646283) message to the window that receives the input focus. It also activates either the window or its parent.  \n  \n If the current window is active but does not have the focus (that is, no window has the focus), any key pressed will produce the messages [WM_SYSCHAR](#cwnd__onsyschar), [WM_SYSKEYDOWN](#cwnd__onsyskeydown), or [WM_SYSKEYUP](#cwnd__onsyskeyup).  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__setfont\"></a>  CWnd::SetFont  \n Sends the `WM_SETFONT` message to the window to use the specified font.  \n  \n```  \nvoid SetFont(\n    CFont* pFont,  \n    BOOL bRedraw = TRUE);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `pFont`  \n Pointer to a `CFont` object.  \n  \n `bRedraw`  \n `TRUE` for the window to redraw immediately after it processes the `WM_SETFONT` message; otherwise `FALSE`.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n This method has no effect unless the window processes the `WM_SETFONT` message. Many MFC classes that derive from `CWnd` process this message because they are attached to a predefined window class that includes a message handler for the `WM_SETFONT` message. To use this method, classes that you derive from `CWnd` must define a method handler for the `WM_SETFONT` message.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__seticon\"></a>  CWnd::SetIcon  \n Call this member function to set the handle to a specific icon, as identified by `hIcon`.  \n  \n```  \nHICON SetIcon(\n    HICON hIcon,  \n    BOOL bBigIcon);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `hIcon`  \n A handle to a previous icon.  \n  \n `bBigIcon`  \n Specifies a 32 pixel by 32 pixel icon if **TRUE**; specifies a 16 pixel by 16 pixel icon if **FALSE**.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n A handle to an icon.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n When the window class is registered, it selects an icon.  \n  \n### Example  \n  See the example for [CWnd::GetSystemMenu](#cwnd__getsystemmenu).  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__setlayeredwindowattributes\"></a>  CWnd::SetLayeredWindowAttributes  \n Sets the opacity and transparency color key of a layered window.  \n  \n```  \nBOOL SetLayeredWindowAttributes(\n    COLORREF crKey,  \n    BYTE bAlpha,  \n    DWORD dwFlags);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `crKey`  \n Pointer to a **COLORREF** value that specifies the transparency color key to be used when composing the layered window. All pixels painted by the window in this color will be transparent. To generate a **COLORREF**, use the RGB macro.  \n  \n `bAlpha`  \n Alpha value used to describe the opacity of the layered window. For more information, see the **SourceConstantAlpha** member of the [BLENDFUNCTION](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd183393) structure. When `bAlpha` is 0, the window is completely transparent. When `bAlpha` is 255, the window is opaque.  \n  \n `dwFlags`  \n Specifies an action to take. This parameter can be one or more of the following values. For a list of possible values, see [SetLayeredWindowAttributes](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms633540).  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Nonzero if the function succeeds; otherwise 0.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n This member function emulates the functionality of the function [SetLayeredWindowAttributes](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms633540), as described in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../../atl/includes/winsdk_md.md)].  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__setmenu\"></a>  CWnd::SetMenu  \n Sets the current menu to the specified menu.  \n  \n```  \nBOOL SetMenu(CMenu* pMenu);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `pMenu`  \n Identifies the new menu. If this parameter is **NULL**, the current menu is removed.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Nonzero if the menu is changed; otherwise 0.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n Causes the window to be redrawn to reflect the menu change.  \n  \n `SetMenu` will not destroy a previous menu. An application should call the [CMenu::DestroyMenu](../../mfc/reference/cmenu-class.md#cmenu__destroymenu) member function to accomplish this task.  \n  \n### Example  \n  See the example for [CMenu::LoadMenu](../../mfc/reference/cmenu-class.md#cmenu__loadmenu).  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__setowner\"></a>  CWnd::SetOwner  \n Sets the current window's owner to the specified window object.  \n  \n```  \nvoid SetOwner(CWnd* pOwnerWnd);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n *pOwnerWnd*  \n Identifies the new owner of the window object. If this parameter is **NULL**, the window object has no owner.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n This owner can then receive command messages from the current window object. By default, the parent of the current window is its owner.  \n  \n It is often useful to establish connections between window objects that are unrelated to the window hierarchy. For example, [CToolBar](../../mfc/reference/ctoolbar-class.md) sends notifications to its owner instead of to its parent. This allows the toolbar to become the child of one window (such as an OLE container application window) while sending notifications to another window (such as the in-place frame window). Furthermore, when a server window is deactivated or activated during in-place editing, any window owned by the frame window is hidden or shown. This ownership is explicitly set with a call to `SetOwner`.  \n  \n The ownership concept of this function is different from the ownership concept of [GetWindow](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms633515).  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__setparent\"></a>  CWnd::SetParent  \n Changes the parent window of a child window.  \n  \n```  \nCWnd* SetParent(CWnd* pWndNewParent);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n *pWndNewParent*  \n Identifies the new parent window.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n A pointer to the previous parent window object if successful. The returned pointer may be temporary and should not be stored for later use.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n If the child window is visible, Windows performs the appropriate redrawing and repainting.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__setproperty\"></a>  CWnd::SetProperty  \n Call this member function to set the OLE control property specified by `dwDispID`.  \n  \n```  \nvoid AFX_CDECL SetProperty(\n    DISPID dwDispID,  \n    VARTYPE vtProp, ...);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `dwDispID`  \n Identifies the property to be set.  \n  \n `vtProp`  \n Specifies the type of the property to be set. For possible values, see the Remarks section for [COleDispatchDriver::InvokeHelper](../../mfc/reference/coledispatchdriver-class.md#coledispatchdriver__invokehelper).  \n  \n *...*  \n A single parameter of the type specified by `vtProp`.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  This function should be called only on a `CWnd` object that represents an OLE control.  \n  \n For more information about using this member function with OLE Control Containers, see the article [ActiveX Control Containers: Programming ActiveX Controls in an ActiveX Control Container](../../mfc/programming-activex-controls-in-a-activex-control-container.md).  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__setredraw\"></a>  CWnd::SetRedraw  \n An application calls `SetRedraw` to allow changes to be redrawn or to prevent changes from being redrawn.  \n  \n```  \nvoid SetRedraw(BOOL bRedraw = TRUE);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `bRedraw`  \n Specifies the state of the redraw flag. If this parameter is **TRUE**, the redraw flag is set; if **FALSE**, the flag is cleared.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n This member function sets or clears the redraw flag. While the redraw flag is cleared, the contents will not be updated after each change and will not be repainted until the redraw flag is set. For example, an application that needs to add several items to a list box can clear the redraw flag, add the items, and then set the redraw flag. Finally, the application can call the [Invalidate](#cwnd__invalidate) or [InvalidateRect](#cwnd__invalidaterect) member function to cause the list box to be repainted.  \n  \n### Example  \n [!code-cpp[NVC_MFCWindowing#117](../../mfc/reference/codesnippet/cpp/cwnd-class_58.cpp)]  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__setscrollinfo\"></a>  CWnd::SetScrollInfo  \n Call this member function to set the information that the `SCROLLINFO` structure maintains about a scroll bar.  \n  \n```  \nBOOL SetScrollInfo(\n    int nBar,  \n    LPSCROLLINFO lpScrollInfo,  \n    BOOL bRedraw = TRUE);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `nBar`  \n Specifies whether the scroll bar is a control or part of a window's nonclient area. If it is part of the nonclient area, nBar also indicates whether the scroll bar is positioned horizontally, vertically, or both. It must be one of the following:  \n  \n- **SB_CTL** Contains the parameters for a scroll bar control. The `m_hWnd` data member must be the handle of the scroll bar control.  \n  \n- **SB_HORZ** Specifies that the window is a horizontal scroll bar.  \n  \n- **SB_VERT** Specifies that the window is a vertical scroll bar.  \n  \n `lpScrollInfo`  \n A pointer to a [SCROLLINFO](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb787537) structure. See the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../../atl/includes/winsdk_md.md)] for more information about this structure.  \n  \n `bRedraw`  \n Specifies whether the scroll bar should be redrawn to reflect the new position. If `bRedraw` is **TRUE**, the scroll bar is redrawn. If it is **FALSE**, it is not redrawn. The scroll bar is redrawn by default.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n If successful, the return is **TRUE**. Otherwise, it is **FALSE**.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The [SCROLLINFO](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb787537) structure contains information about a scroll bar, including the minimum and maximum scrolling positions, the page size, and the position of the scroll box (the thumb). See the `SCROLLINFO` structure topic in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../../atl/includes/winsdk_md.md)] for more information about changing the structure defaults.  \n  \n The MFC Windows message handlers that indicate scroll-bar position, [CWnd::OnHScroll](#cwnd__onhscroll) and [CWnd::OnVScroll](#cwnd__onvscroll), provide only 16 bits of position data. [GetScrollInfo](#cwnd__getscrollinfo) and `SetScrollInfo` provide 32 bits of scroll-bar position data. Thus, an application can call `GetScrollInfo` while processing either `CWnd::OnHScroll` or `CWnd::OnVScroll` to obtain 32-bit scroll-bar position data.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n> [CWnd::GetScrollInfo](#cwnd__getscrollinfo) enables applications to use 32-bit scroll-bar positions.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__setscrollpos\"></a>  CWnd::SetScrollPos  \n Sets the current position of a scroll box and, if requested, redraws the scroll bar to reflect the new position of the scroll box.  \n  \n```  \nint SetScrollPos(\n    int nBar,  \n    int nPos,  \n    BOOL bRedraw = TRUE);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `nBar`  \n Specifies the scroll bar to be set. This parameter can be either of the following:  \n  \n- **SB_HORZ** Sets the position of the scroll box in the horizontal scroll bar of the window.  \n  \n- **SB_VERT** Sets the position of the scroll box in the vertical scroll bar of the window.  \n  \n `nPos`  \n Specifies the new position of the scroll box. It must be within the scrolling range.  \n  \n `bRedraw`  \n Specifies whether the scroll bar should be repainted to reflect the new scroll-box position. If this parameter is **TRUE**, the scroll bar is repainted; if **FALSE**, the scroll bar is not repainted.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n The previous position of the scroll box.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n Setting `bRedraw` to **FALSE** is useful whenever the scroll bar will be redrawn by a subsequent call to another function.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__setscrollrange\"></a>  CWnd::SetScrollRange  \n Sets minimum and maximum position values for the given scroll bar.  \n  \n```  \nvoid SetScrollRange(\n    int nBar,  \n    int nMinPos,  \n    int nMaxPos,  \n    BOOL bRedraw = TRUE);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `nBar`  \n Specifies the scroll bar to be set. This parameter can be either of the following values:  \n  \n- **SB_HORZ** Sets the range of the horizontal scroll bar of the window.  \n  \n- **SB_VERT** Sets the range of the vertical scroll bar of the window.  \n  \n `nMinPos`  \n Specifies the minimum scrolling position.  \n  \n `nMaxPos`  \n Specifies the maximum scrolling position.  \n  \n `bRedraw`  \n Specifies whether the scroll bar should be redrawn to reflect the change. If `bRedraw` is **TRUE**, the scroll bar is redrawn; if **FALSE**, the scroll bar is not redrawn.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n It can also be used to hide or show standard scroll bars.  \n  \n An application should not call this function to hide a scroll bar while processing a scroll-bar notification message.  \n  \n If the call to `SetScrollRange` immediately follows a call to the [SetScrollPos](#cwnd__setscrollpos) member function, the `bRedraw` parameter in the `SetScrollPos` member function should be 0 to prevent the scroll bar from being drawn twice.  \n  \n The default range for a standard scroll bar is 0 through 100. The default range for a scroll bar control is empty (both the `nMinPos` and `nMaxPos` values are 0). The difference between the values specified by `nMinPos` and `nMaxPos` must not be greater than **INT_MAX**.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__settimer\"></a>  CWnd::SetTimer  \n Installs a system timer.  \n  \n```  \nUINT_PTR SetTimer(\n    UINT_PTR nIDEvent,  \n    UINT nElapse,  \n    void (CALLBACK* lpfnTimer)(HWND,  \n    UINT, \n    UINT_PTR, \n    DWORD));\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `nIDEvent`  \n Specifies a nonzero timer identifier. If the timer identifier is unique, this same value is returned by `SetTimer`. Otherwise, `SetTimer` determines a new unique value and returns that. For a window timer (which has a NULL callback function), the value must be unique only for other windows timers that are associated with the current window. For a callback timer, the value must be unique for all timers in all processes. Therefore, when you create a callback timer, it is more likely that the returned value might differ from the value you specify.  \n  \n `nElapse`  \n Specifies the time-out value, or interval, in milliseconds.  \n  \n `lpfnTimer`  \n Specifies the address of the application-supplied `TimerProc` callback function that processes the [WM_TIMER](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms644902) messages. If this parameter is `NULL`, the `WM_TIMER` messages are placed in the message queue of the application and handled by the `CWnd` object.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n The timer identifier of the new timer if the function is successful. This value may or may not be equal to the value passed in through the `nIDEvent` parameter. An application should always pass the return value to the [KillTimer](#cwnd__killtimer) member function to kill the timer. Nonzero if successful; otherwise, 0.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n An interval value is specified, and every time the interval elapses, the system posts a `WM_TIMER` message to the installing message queue of the installing application or passes the message to an application-defined `TimerProc` callback function.  \n  \n The `lpfnTimer` callback function need not be named `TimerProc`, but it must be declared as static and defined as follows.  \n  \n```  \nvoid CALLBACK TimerProc(\n    HWND hWnd,   // handle of CWnd that called SetTimer  \n    UINT nMsg,   // WM_TIMER  \n    UINT_PTR nIDEvent,   // timer identification  \n    DWORD dwTime    // system time);\n```  \n  \n### Example  \n This example uses `CWnd::SetTimer`, `CWnd::OnTimer`, and `CWnd::KillTimer` to handle `WM_TIMER` messages. The first timer is set up to send a `WM_TIMER` message to the main frame window every 2 seconds in `OnStartTimer`. The `OnTimer` event handler handles `WM_TIMER` messages for the main frame window. This method causes the PC speaker to beep every 2 seconds. The second timer sends a message to the callback function every 3.75 seconds. `OnStopTimer` will stop both timers by calling `CWnd::KillTimer` for each timer ID.  \n  \n [!code-cpp[NVC_MFCWindowing#118](../../mfc/reference/codesnippet/cpp/cwnd-class_59.cpp)]  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__setwindowcontexthelpid\"></a>  CWnd::SetWindowContextHelpId  \n Call this member function to associate a help context identifier with the specified window.  \n  \n```  \nBOOL SetWindowContextHelpId(DWORD dwContextHelpId);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `dwContextHelpId`  \n The help context identifier.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Nonzero if the function is successful; otherwise 0.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n If a child window does not have a help context identifier, it inherits the identifier of its parent window. Likewise, if an owned window does not have a help context identifier, it inherits the identifier of its owner window. This inheritance of help context identifiers allows an application to set just one identifier for a dialog box and all of its controls.  \n  \n### Example  \n [!code-cpp[NVC_MFCWindowing#119](../../mfc/reference/codesnippet/cpp/cwnd-class_60.cpp)]  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__setwindowplacement\"></a>  CWnd::SetWindowPlacement  \n Sets the show state and the normal (restored), minimized, and maximized positions for a window.  \n  \n```  \nBOOL SetWindowPlacement(const WINDOWPLACEMENT* lpwndpl);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `lpwndpl`  \n Points to a [WINDOWPLACEMENT](../../mfc/reference/windowplacement-structure.md) structure that specifies the new show state and positions.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Nonzero if the function is successful; otherwise 0.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__setwindowpos\"></a>  CWnd::SetWindowPos  \n Changes the size, position, and Z-order of child, pop-up, and top-level windows.  \n  \n```  \nBOOL SetWindowPos(\n    const CWnd* pWndInsertAfter,  \n    int x,  \n    int y,  \n    int cx,  \n    int cy,  \n    UINT nFlags);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `pWndInsertAfter`  \n Identifies the `CWnd` object that will precede (be higher than) this `CWnd` object in the Z-order. This parameter can be a pointer to a `CWnd` or a **Pointer** to one of the following values:  \n  \n- **wndBottom** Places the window at the bottom of the Z-order. If this `CWnd` is a topmost window, the window loses its topmost status; the system places the window at the bottom of all other windows.  \n  \n- **wndTop** Places the window at the top of the Z-order.  \n  \n- **wndTopMost** Places the window above all non-topmost windows. The window maintains its topmost position even when it is deactivated.  \n  \n- **wndNoTopMost** Repositions the window to the top of all non-topmost windows (that is, behind all topmost windows). This flag has no effect if the window is already a non-topmost window.  \n  \n For rules about how to use this parameter, see the \"Remarks\" section of this topic.  \n  \n *x*  \n Specifies the new position of the left side of the window.  \n  \n *y*  \n Specifies the new position of the top of the window.  \n  \n `cx`  \n Specifies the new width of the window.  \n  \n `cy`  \n Specifies the new height of the window.  \n  \n `nFlags`  \n Specifies sizing and positioning options. This parameter can be a combination of the following flags:  \n  \n- **SWP_DRAWFRAME** Draws a frame (defined when the window was created) around the window.  \n  \n- **SWP_FRAMECHANGED** Sends a `WM_NCCALCSIZE` message to the window, even if the window's size is not being changed. If this flag is not specified, `WM_NCCALCSIZE` is sent only when the window's size is being changed.  \n  \n- **SWP_HIDEWINDOW** Hides the window.  \n  \n- `SWP_NOACTIVATE` Does not activate the window. If this flag is not set, the window is activated and moved to the top of either the topmost or the non-topmost group (depending on the setting of the `pWndInsertAfter` parameter).  \n  \n- **SWP_NOCOPYBITS** Discards the entire contents of the client area. If this flag is not specified, the valid contents of the client area are saved and copied back into the client area after the window is sized or repositioned.  \n  \n- `SWP_NOMOVE` Retains current position (ignores the *x* and *y* parameters).  \n  \n- **SWP_NOOWNERZORDER** Does not change the owner window's position in the Z-order.  \n  \n- **SWP_NOREDRAW** Does not redraw changes. If this flag is set, no repainting of any kind occurs. This applies to the client area, the nonclient area (including the title and scroll bars), and any part of the parent window uncovered as a result of the moved window. When this flag is set, the application must explicitly invalidate or redraw any parts of the window and parent window that must be redrawn.  \n  \n- **SWP_NOREPOSITION** Same as **SWP_NOOWNERZORDER**.  \n  \n- **SWP_NOSENDCHANGING** Prevents the window from receiving the `WM_WINDOWPOSCHANGING` message.  \n  \n- `SWP_NOSIZE` Retains current size (ignores the `cx` and `cy` parameters).  \n  \n- `SWP_NOZORDER` Retains current ordering (ignores `pWndInsertAfter`).  \n  \n- **SWP_SHOWWINDOW** Displays the window.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Nonzero if the function is successful; otherwise, 0.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n Windows are ordered on the screen according to their Z-order; the window at the top of the Z-order appears on top of all other windows in the order.  \n  \n All coordinates for child windows are client coordinates (relative to the upper-left corner of the parent window's client area).  \n  \n A window can be moved to the top of the Z-order either by setting the `pWndInsertAfter` parameter to **&wndTopMost** and ensuring that the `SWP_NOZORDER` flag is not set or by setting a window's Z-order so that it is above any existing topmost windows. When a non-topmost window is made topmost, its owned windows are also made topmost. Its owners are not changed.  \n  \n A topmost window is no longer topmost if it is repositioned to the bottom ( **&wndBottom**) of the Z-order or after any non-topmost window. When a topmost window is made non-topmost, all of its owners and its owned windows are also made non-topmost windows.  \n  \n If neither `SWP_NOACTIVATE` nor `SWP_NOZORDER` is specified (that is, when the application requests that a window be simultaneously activated and placed in the specified Z-order), the value specified in `pWndInsertAfter` is used only in the following circumstances:  \n  \n-   Neither **&wndTopMost** nor **&wndNoTopMost** is specified in the `pWndInsertAfter` parameter.  \n  \n-   This window is not the active window.  \n  \n An application cannot activate an inactive window without also bringing it to the top of the Z-order. Applications can change the Z-order of an activated window without restrictions.  \n  \n A non-topmost window may own a topmost window, but not vice versa. Any window (for example, a dialog box) owned by a topmost window is itself made a topmost window to ensure that all owned windows stay above their owner.  \n  \n With Windows versions 3.1 and later, windows can be moved to the top of the Z-order and locked there by setting their **WS_EX_TOPMOST** styles. Such a topmost window maintains its topmost position even when deactivated. For example, selecting the WinHelp Always On Top command makes the Help window topmost, and it then remains visible when you return to your application.  \n  \n To create a topmost window, call `SetWindowPos` with the `pWndInsertAfter` parameter equal to **&wndTopMost**, or set the **WS_EX_TOPMOST** style when you create the window.  \n  \n If the Z-order contains any windows with the **WS_EX_TOPMOST** style, a window moved with the **&wndTopMost** value is placed at the top of all non-topmost windows, but below any topmost windows. When an application activates an inactive window without the **WS_EX_TOPMOST** bit, the window is moved above all non-topmost windows but below any topmost windows.  \n  \n If `SetWindowPos` is called when the `pWndInsertAfter` parameter is **&wndBottom** and `CWnd` is a topmost window, the window loses its topmost status ( **WS_EX_TOPMOST** is cleared), and the system places the window at the bottom of the Z-order.  \n  \n### Example  \n [!code-cpp[NVC_MFCWindowing#120](../../mfc/reference/codesnippet/cpp/cwnd-class_61.cpp)]  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__setwindowrgn\"></a>  CWnd::SetWindowRgn  \n Call this member function to set a window's region.  \n  \n```  \nint SetWindowRgn(\n    HRGN hRgn,  \n    BOOL bRedraw);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `hRgn`  \n A handle to a region.  \n  \n `bRedraw`  \n If **TRUE**, the operating system redraws the window after setting the region; otherwise, it does not. Typically, set `bRedraw` to **TRUE** if the window is visible. If set to **TRUE**, the system sends the `WM_WINDOWPOSCHANGING` and `WM_WINDOWPOSCHANGED` messages to the window.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n If the function succeeds, the return value is nonzero. If the function fails, the return value is zero.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The coordinates of a window's window region are relative to the upper-left corner of the window, not the client area of the window.  \n  \n After a successful call to `SetWindowRgn`, the operating system owns the region specified by the region handle `hRgn`. The operating system does not make a copy of the region, so do not make any further function calls with this region handle, and do not close this region handle.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__setwindowtext\"></a>  CWnd::SetWindowText  \n Sets the window's title to the specified text.  \n  \n```  \nvoid SetWindowText(LPCTSTR lpszString);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `lpszString`  \n Points to a [CString](../../atl-mfc-shared/reference/cstringt-class.md) object or null-terminated string to be used as the new title or control text.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n If the window is a control, the text within the control is set.  \n  \n This function causes a [WM_SETTEXT](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms632644) message to be sent to this window.  \n  \n### Example  \n [!code-cpp[NVC_MFCWindowing#121](../../mfc/reference/codesnippet/cpp/cwnd-class_62.cpp)]  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__showcaret\"></a>  CWnd::ShowCaret  \n Shows the caret on the screen at the caret's current position.  \n  \n```  \nvoid ShowCaret();\n```  \n  \n### Remarks  \n Once shown, the caret begins flashing automatically.  \n  \n The `ShowCaret` member function shows the caret only if it has a current shape and has not been hidden two or more times consecutively. If the caret is not owned by this window, the caret is not shown.  \n  \n Hiding the caret is cumulative. If the [HideCaret](#cwnd__hidecaret) member function has been called five times consecutively, `ShowCaret` must be called five times to show the caret.  \n  \n The caret is a shared resource. The window should show the caret only when it has the input focus or is active.  \n  \n### Example  \n  See the example for [CWnd::CreateCaret](#cwnd__createcaret).  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__showownedpopups\"></a>  CWnd::ShowOwnedPopups  \n Shows or hides all pop-up windows owned by this window.  \n  \n```  \nvoid ShowOwnedPopups(BOOL bShow = TRUE);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `bShow`  \n Specifies whether pop-up windows are to be shown or hidden. If this parameter is **TRUE**, all hidden pop-up windows are shown. If this parameter is **FALSE**, all visible pop-up windows are hidden.  \n  \n### Example  \n  See the example for [CWnd::SetWindowPos](#cwnd__setwindowpos).  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__showscrollbar\"></a>  CWnd::ShowScrollBar  \n Shows or hides a scroll bar.  \n  \n```  \nvoid ShowScrollBar(\n    UINT nBar,  \n    BOOL bShow = TRUE);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `nBar`  \n Specifies whether the scroll bar is a control or part of a window's nonclient area. If it is part of the nonclient area, `nBar` also indicates whether the scroll bar is positioned horizontally, vertically, or both. It must be one of the following:  \n  \n- **SB_BOTH** Specifies the horizontal and vertical scroll bars of the window.  \n  \n- **SB_HORZ** Specifies that the window is a horizontal scroll bar.  \n  \n- **SB_VERT** Specifies that the window is a vertical scroll bar.  \n  \n `bShow`  \n Specifies whether Windows shows or hides the scroll bar. If this parameter is **TRUE**, the scroll bar is shown; otherwise the scroll bar is hidden.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n An application should not call `ShowScrollBar` to hide a scroll bar while processing a scroll-bar notification message.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__showwindow\"></a>  CWnd::ShowWindow  \n Sets the visibility state of the window.  \n  \n```  \nBOOL ShowWindow(int nCmdShow);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `nCmdShow`  \n Specifies how the `CWnd` is to be shown. It must be one of the following values:  \n  \n- **SW_HIDE** Hides this window and passes activation to another window.  \n  \n- **SW_MINIMIZE** Minimizes the window and activates the top-level window in the system's list.  \n  \n- **SW_RESTORE** Activates and displays the window. If the window is minimized or maximized, Windows restores it to its original size and position.  \n  \n- **SW_SHOW** Activates the window and displays it in its current size and position.  \n  \n- **SW_SHOWMAXIMIZED** Activates the window and displays it as a maximized window.  \n  \n- **SW_SHOWMINIMIZED** Activates the window and displays it as an icon.  \n  \n- **SW_SHOWMINNOACTIVE** Displays the window as an icon. The window that is currently active remains active.  \n  \n- **SW_SHOWNA** Displays the window in its current state. The window that is currently active remains active.  \n  \n- **SW_SHOWNOACTIVATE** Displays the window in its most recent size and position. The window that is currently active remains active.  \n  \n- **SW_SHOWNORMAL** Activates and displays the window. If the window is minimized or maximized, Windows restores it to its original size and position.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Nonzero if the window was previously visible; 0 if the `CWnd` was previously hidden.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n `ShowWindow` must be called only once per application for the main window with [CWinApp::m_nCmdShow](../../mfc/reference/cwinapp-class.md#cwinapp__m_ncmdshow). Subsequent calls to `ShowWindow` must use one of the values listed above instead of the one specified by `CWinApp::m_nCmdShow`.  \n  \n### Example  \n  See the example for [CWnd::CalcWindowRect](#cwnd__calcwindowrect).  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__subclassdlgitem\"></a>  CWnd::SubclassDlgItem  \n Call this member function to \"dynamically subclass\" a control created from a dialog template and attach it to this `CWnd` object.  \n  \n```  \nBOOL SubclassDlgItem(\n    UINT nID,  \n    CWnd* pParent);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `nID`  \n The control's ID.  \n  \n `pParent`  \n The control's parent (usually a dialog box).  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Nonzero if the function is successful; otherwise 0.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n When a control is dynamically subclassed, windows messages will route through the `CWnd`'s message map and call message handlers in the `CWnd`'s class first. Messages that are passed to the base class will be passed to the default message handler in the control.  \n  \n This member function attaches the Windows control to a `CWnd` object and replaces the control's **WndProc** and **AfxWndProc** functions. The function stores the old **WndProc** in the location returned by the `GetSuperWndProcAddr` member function.  \n  \n### Example  \n [!code-cpp[NVC_MFCWindowing#122](../../mfc/reference/codesnippet/cpp/cwnd-class_63.cpp)]  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__subclasswindow\"></a>  CWnd::SubclassWindow  \n Call this member function to \"dynamically subclass\" a window and attach it to this `CWnd` object.  \n  \n```  \nBOOL SubclassWindow(HWND hWnd);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `hWnd`  \n A handle to the window.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Nonzero if the function is successful; otherwise 0.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n When a window is dynamically subclassed, windows messages will route through the `CWnd`'s message map and call message handlers in the `CWnd`'s class first. Messages that are passed to the base class will be passed to the default message handler in the window.  \n  \n This member function attaches the Windows control to a `CWnd` object and replaces the window's **WndProc** and **AfxWndProc** functions. The function stores a pointer to the old **WndProc** in the `CWnd` object.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The window must not already be attached to an MFC object when this function is called.  \n  \n### Example  \n [!code-cpp[NVC_MFCWindowing#123](../../mfc/reference/codesnippet/cpp/cwnd-class_64.cpp)]  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__unlockwindowupdate\"></a>  CWnd::UnlockWindowUpdate  \n Call this member function to unlock a window that was locked with `CWnd::LockWindowUpdate`.  \n  \n```  \nvoid UnlockWindowUpdate();\n```  \n  \n### Remarks  \n Only one window at a time can be locked using `LockWindowUpdate`. See [CWnd::LockWindowUpdate](#cwnd__lockwindowupdate) or the Win32 function [LockWindowUpdate](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd145034) for more information on locking windows.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__unsubclasswindow\"></a>  CWnd::UnsubclassWindow  \n Call this member function to set **WndProc** back to its original value and detach the window identified by `HWND` from the **CWnd** object.  \n  \n```  \nHWND UnsubclassWindow();\n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n A handle to the unsubclassed window.  \n  \n### Example  \n  See the example for [CWnd::SubclassWindow](#cwnd__subclasswindow).  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__updatedata\"></a>  CWnd::UpdateData  \n Call this member function to initialize data in a dialog box, or to retrieve and validate dialog data.  \n  \n```  \nBOOL UpdateData(BOOL bSaveAndValidate = TRUE);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `bSaveAndValidate`  \n Flag that indicates whether dialog box is being initialized ( **FALSE**) or data is being retrieved ( **TRUE**).  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Nonzero if the operation is successful; otherwise 0. If *bSaveAndValidat*e is **TRUE**, then a return value of nonzero means that the data is successfully validated.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The framework automatically calls `UpdateData` with `bSaveAndValidate` set to **FALSE** when a modal dialog box is created in the default implementation of [CDialog::OnInitDialog](../../mfc/reference/cdialog-class.md#cdialog__oninitdialog). The call occurs before the dialog box is visible. The default implementation of [CDialog::OnOK](../../mfc/reference/cdialog-class.md#cdialog__onok) calls this member function with `bSaveAndValidate` set to **TRUE** to retrieve the data, and if successful, will close the dialog box. (If the Cancel button is clicked in the dialog box, the dialog box is closed without the data being retrieved.)  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__updatedialogcontrols\"></a>  CWnd::UpdateDialogControls  \n Call this member function to update the state of dialog buttons and other controls in a dialog box or window that uses the [ON_UPDATE_COMMAND_UI](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/c4de3c21-2d2e-4b89-a4ce-d0c0e2d9edc4) callback mechanism.  \n  \n```  \nvoid UpdateDialogControls(\n    CCmdTarget* pTarget,  \n    BOOL bDisableIfNoHndler);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `pTarget`  \n Points to the main frame window of the application, and is used for routing update messages *.*  \n  \n `bDisableIfNoHndler`  \n Flag that indicates whether a control that has no update handler should be automatically displayed as disabled.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n If a child control does not have a handler and `bDisableIfNoHndler` is **TRUE**, then the child control will be disabled.  \n  \n The framework calls this member function for controls in dialog bars or toolbars as part of the application's idle processing.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__updatelayeredwindow\"></a>  CWnd::UpdateLayeredWindow  \n Updates the position, size, shape, content, and translucency of a layered window.  \n  \n```  \nBOOL UpdateLayeredWindow(\n    CDC* pDCDst,  \n    POINT* pptDst,  \n    SIZE* psize,  \n    CDC* pDCSrc,  \n    POINT* pptSrc,  \n    COLORREF crKey,  \n    BLENDFUNCTION* pblend,  \n    DWORD dwFlags);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `pDCDst`  \n A pointer to a device context for the screen. It is used for palette color matching when the window contents are updated. If `pDCDst` is **NULL**, the default palette will be used.  \n  \n If `pDCSrc` is **NULL**, `pDCDst` must be **NULL**.  \n  \n `pptDst`  \n A pointer to a **POINT** structure specifying the new screen position of the layered window. If the current position is not changing, `pptDst` can be **NULL**.  \n  \n *psize*  \n Pointer to a **SIZE** structure that specifies the new size of the layered window. If the size of the window is not changing, *psize* can be **NULL**.  \n  \n If `pDCSrc` is **NULL**, *psize* must be **NULL**.  \n  \n `pDCSrc`  \n A pointer to a DC for the surface that defines the layered window. If the shape and visual context of the window are not changing, `pDCSrc` can be **NULL**.  \n  \n `pptSrc`  \n Pointer to a **POINT** structure that specifies the location of the layer in the device context.  \n  \n If `pDCSrc` is **NULL**, `pptSrc` should be **NULL**.  \n  \n `crKey`  \n Pointer to a **COLORREF** value that specifies the transparency color key to be used when composing the layered window. All pixels painted by the window in this color will be transparent. To generate a **COLORREF**, use the RGB macro.  \n  \n *pblend*  \n Pointer to a [BLENDFUNCTION](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd183393) structure that specifies the transparency value to be used when composing the layered window.  \n  \n `dwFlags`  \n Specifies an action to take. This parameter can be one or more of the following values. For a list of possible values, see [UpdateLayeredWindow](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms633556).  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Nonzero if the function succeeds; otherwise 0.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n This member function emulates the functionality of the function [UpdateLayeredWindow](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms633556), as described in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../../atl/includes/winsdk_md.md)].  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__updatewindow\"></a>  CWnd::UpdateWindow  \n Updates the client area by sending a [WM_PAINT](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd145213) message if the update region is not empty.  \n  \n```  \nvoid UpdateWindow();\n```  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The `UpdateWindow` member function sends a `WM_PAINT` message directly, bypassing the application queue. If the update region is empty, `WM_PAINT` is not sent.  \n  \n### Example  \n [!code-cpp[NVC_MFCWindowing#124](../../mfc/reference/codesnippet/cpp/cwnd-class_65.cpp)]  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__validaterect\"></a>  CWnd::ValidateRect  \n Validates the client area within the given rectangle by removing the rectangle from the update region of the window.  \n  \n```  \nvoid ValidateRect(LPCRECT lpRect);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `lpRect`  \n Points to a [CRect](../../atl-mfc-shared/reference/crect-class.md) object or [RECT structure](../../mfc/reference/rect-structure1.md) that contains client coordinates of the rectangle to be removed from the update region. If `lpRect` is **NULL**, the entire window is validated.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The [BeginPaint](#cwnd__beginpaint) member function automatically validates the entire client area. Neither the `ValidateRect` nor the [ValidateRgn](#cwnd__validatergn) member function should be called if a portion of the update region needs to be validated before [WM_PAINT](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd145213) is next generated.  \n  \n Windows continues to generate `WM_PAINT` messages until the current update region is validated.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__validatergn\"></a>  CWnd::ValidateRgn  \n Validates the client area within the given region by removing the region from the current update region of the window.  \n  \n```  \nvoid ValidateRgn(CRgn* pRgn);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `pRgn`  \n A pointer to a [CRgn](../../mfc/reference/crgn-class.md) object that identifies a region that defines the area to be removed from the update region. If this parameter is **NULL**, the entire client area is removed.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The given region must have been created previously by a region function. The region coordinates are assumed to be client coordinates.  \n  \n The [BeginPaint](#cwnd__beginpaint) member function automatically validates the entire client area. Neither the [ValidateRect](#cwnd__validaterect) nor the `ValidateRgn` member function should be called if a portion of the update region must be validated before the next [WM_PAINT](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd145213) message is generated.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__windowfrompoint\"></a>  CWnd::WindowFromPoint  \n Retrieves the window that contains the specified point; `point` must specify the screen coordinates of a point on the screen.  \n  \n```  \nstatic CWnd* PASCAL WindowFromPoint(POINT point);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `point`  \n Specifies a [CPoint](../../atl-mfc-shared/reference/cpoint-class.md) object or [POINT](../../mfc/reference/point-structure1.md) data structure that defines the point to be checked.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n A pointer to the window object in which the point lies. It is **NULL** if no window exists at the given point. The returned pointer may be temporary and should not be stored for later use.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n `WindowFromPoint` does not retrieve a hidden or disabled window, even if the point is within the window. An application should use the [ChildWindowFromPoint](#cwnd__childwindowfrompoint) member function for a nonrestrictive search.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__windowproc\"></a>  CWnd::WindowProc  \n Provides a Windows procedure ( `WindowProc`) for a `CWnd` object.  \n  \n```  \nvirtual LRESULT WindowProc(\n    UINT message,  \n    WPARAM wParam,  \n    LPARAM lParam);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `message`  \n Specifies the Windows message to be processed.  \n  \n `wParam`  \n Provides additional information used in processing the message. The parameter value depends on the message.  \n  \n `lParam`  \n Provides additional information used in processing the message. The parameter value depends on the message.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n The return value depends on the message.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n It dispatches messages through the window's message map.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__winhelp\"></a>  CWnd::WinHelp  \n Called to initiate the WinHelp application.  \n  \n```  \nvirtual void WinHelp(\n    DWORD_PTR dwData,  \n    UINT nCmd = HELP_CONTEXT);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `dwData`  \n Specifies additional data. The value used depends on the value of the `nCmd` parameter.  \n  \n `nCmd`  \n Specifies the type of help requested. For a list of possible values and how they affect the `dwData` parameter, see the [WinHelp](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb762267) Windows function in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../../atl/includes/winsdk_md.md)].  \n  \n### Remarks  \n See [CWinApp::WinHelp](../../mfc/reference/cwinapp-class.md#cwinapp__winhelp) for more information.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__registertouchwindow\"></a>  CWnd::RegisterTouchWindow  \n Registers or unregisters Windows touch support.  \n  \n```  \nBOOL RegisterTouchWindow(\n    BOOL bRegister = TRUE,  \n    ULONG ulFlags = 0);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `bRegister`  \n `TRUE` indicates register Windows touch support; `FALSE` otherwise.  \n  \n `ulFlags`  \n A set of bit flags that specify optional modifications. This field may contain 0 or one of the following values: TWF_FINETOUCH, TWF_WANTPALM.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n `TRUE` if successful; otherwise `FALSE`.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cwnd__resizedynamiclayout\"></a>  CWnd::ResizeDynamicLayout  \n Called by the framework when the window size changes to adjust the layout of child windows, if dynamic layout is enabled for the window.  \n  \n```  \nvirtual void ResizeDynamicLayout();\n```  \n  \n### Remarks  \n  \n## See Also  \n [CCmdTarget Class](../../mfc/reference/ccmdtarget-class.md)   \n [Hierarchy Chart](../../mfc/hierarchy-chart.md)   \n [CFrameWnd Class](../../mfc/reference/cframewnd-class.md)   \n [CView Class](../../mfc/reference/cview-class.md)\n"}
