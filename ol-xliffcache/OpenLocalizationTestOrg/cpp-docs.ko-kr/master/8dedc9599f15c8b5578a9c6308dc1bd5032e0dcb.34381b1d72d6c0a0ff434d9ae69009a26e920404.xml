These panes (also referred to as parts) can contain either a text string, an icon, or both.  \n  \n Use [SetParts](../mfc/reference/cstatusbarctrl-class.md#cstatusbarctrl__setparts) to define how many parts, and the length, the status bar will have. After you have created the parts of the status bar, make calls to [SetText](../mfc/reference/cstatusbarctrl-class.md#cstatusbarctrl__settext) and [SetIcon](../mfc/reference/cstatusbarctrl-class.md#cstatusbarctrl__seticon) to set the text or icon for a specific part of the status bar. Once the part has been successfully set, the control is automatically redrawn.  \n  \n The following example initializes an existing `CStatusBarCtrl` object (`m_StatusBarCtrl`) with four panes and then sets an icon (IDI_ICON1) and some text in the second part.  \n  \n [!code-cpp[NVC_MFCControlLadenDialog#31](../mfc/codesnippet/cpp/initializing-the-parts-of-a-cstatusbarctrl-object_1.cpp)]  \n  \n For more information on setting the mode of a `CStatusBarCtrl` object to simple, see [Setting the Mode of a CStatusBarCtrl Object](../mfc/setting-the-mode-of-a-cstatusbarctrl-object.md).  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Using CStatusBarCtrl](../mfc/using-cstatusbarctrl.md)   \n [Controls](../mfc/controls-mfc.md)\n\n"}
