you access to the Concurrency Runtime, a concurrent programming framework for C++. For more information, see [Concurrency Runtime](../../../parallel/concrt/concurrency-runtime.md).  \n  \n## Syntax  \n  \n```  \nnamespace concurrency;  \n```  \n  \n## Members  \n  \n### Namespaces  \n  \n|Name|Description|  \n|----------|-----------------|  \n|[concurrency::extensibility Namespace](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/16a86ff2-128e-4edf-89e4-38aac79c81f9)||  \n  \n### Typedefs  \n  \n|Name|Description|  \n|----------|-----------------|  \n|`runtime_object_identity`|Each message instance has an identity that follows it as it is cloned and passed between messaging components. This cannot be the address of the message object.|  \n|`task_status`|A type that represents the terminal state of a task. Valid values are `completed` and `canceled`.|  \n|`TaskProc`|An elementary abstraction for a task, defined as `void (__cdecl * TaskProc)(void *)`. A `TaskProc` is called to invoke the body of a task.|  \n|`TaskProc_t`|An elementary abstraction for a task, defined as `void (__cdecl * TaskProc_t)(void *)`. A `TaskProc` is called to invoke the body of a task.|  \n  \n### Classes  \n  \n|Name|Description|  \n|----------|-----------------|  \n|[affinity_partitioner Class](affinity-partitioner-class.md)|The `affinity_partitioner` class is similar to the `static_partitioner` class, but it improves cache affinity by its choice of mapping subranges to worker threads. It can improve performance significantly when a loop is re-executed over the same data set, and the data fits in cache. Note that the same `affinity_partitioner` object must be used with subsequent iterations of a parallel loop that is executed over a particular data set, to benefit from data locality.|  \n|[agent Class](agent-class.md)|A class intended to be used as a base class for all independent agents. It is used to hide state from other agents and interact using message-passing.|  \n|[auto_partitioner Class](auto-partitioner-class.md)|The `auto_partitioner` class represents the default method `parallel_for`, `parallel_for_each` and `parallel_transform` use to partition the range they iterates over. This method of partitioning employes range stealing for load balancing as well as per-iterate cancellation.|  \n|[bad_target Class](bad-target-class.md)|This class describes an exception thrown when a messaging block is given a pointer to a target which is invalid for the operation being performed.|  \n|[call Class](call-class.md)|A `call` messaging block is a multi-source, ordered `target_block` that invokes a specified function when receiving a message.|  \n|[cancellation_token Class](cancellation-token-class.md)|The `cancellation_token` class represents the ability to determine whether some operation has been requested to cancel.

It can also be polled for cancellation or have a callback registered for if and when the associated `cancellation_token_source` is canceled.|  \n|[cancellation_token_registration Class](cancellation-token-registration-class.md)|The `cancellation_token_registration` class represents a callback notification from a `cancellation_token`. When the `register` method on a `cancellation_token` is used to receive notification of when cancellation occurs, a `cancellation_token_registration` object is returned as a handle to the callback so that the caller can request a specific callback no longer be made through use of the `deregister` method.|  \n|[cancellation_token_source Class](cancellation-token-source-class.md)|The `cancellation_token_source` class represents the ability to cancel some cancelable operation.|  \n|[choice Class](choice-class.md)|A `choice` messaging block is a multi-source, single-target block that represents a control-flow interaction with a set of sources. The choice block will wait for any one of multiple sources to produce a message and will propagate the index of the source that produced the message.|  \n|[combinable Class](combinable-class.md)|The `combinable<T>` object is intended to provide thread-private copies of data, to perform lock-free thread-local sub-computations during parallel algorithms. At the end of the parallel operation, the thread-private sub-computations can then be merged into a final result. This class can be used instead of a shared variable, and can result in a performance improvement if there would otherwise be a lot of contention on that shared variable.|  \n|[concurrent_priority_queue Class](concurrent-priority-queue-class.md)|The `concurrent_priority_queue` class is a container that allows multiple threads to concurrently push and pop items.

The sequence is represented in a way that enables concurrency-safe append, element access, iterator access and iterator traversal operations.|  \n|[concurrent_unordered_set Class](concurrent-unordered-set-class.md)|The `concurrent_unordered_set` class is an concurrency-safe container that controls a varying-length sequence of elements of type K. The sequence is represented in a way that enables concurrency-safe append, element access, iterator access and iterator traversal operations.|  \n|[concurrent_vector Class](concurrent-vector-class.md)|The `concurrent_vector` class is a sequence container class that allows random access to any element. It enables concurrency-safe append, element access, iterator access, and iterator traversal operations.|  \n|[Context Class](context-class.md)|Represents an abstraction for an execution context.|  \n|[context_self_unblock Class](context-self-unblock-class.md)|This class describes an exception thrown when the `Unblock` method of a `Context` object is called from the same context.
