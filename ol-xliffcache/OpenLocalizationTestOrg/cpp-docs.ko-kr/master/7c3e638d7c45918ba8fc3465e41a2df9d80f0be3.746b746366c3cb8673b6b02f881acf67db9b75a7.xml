the middle of a multibyte character. A more secure version of this function is available; see [mbsrtowcs_s](../../c-runtime-library/reference/mbsrtowcs-s.md).  \n  \n## Syntax  \n  \n```  \nsize_t mbsrtowcs(  \n   wchar_t *wcstr,  \n   const char **mbstr,  \n   sizeof count,  \n   mbstate_t *mbstate  \n);  \ntemplate <size_t size>  \nsize_t mbsrtowcs(  \n   wchar_t (&wcstr)[size],  \n   const char **mbstr,  \n   sizeof count,  \n   mbstate_t *mbstate  \n); // C++ only  \n```  \n  \n#### Parameters  \n [out] `wcstr`  \n Address to store the resulting converted wide character string.  \n  \n [in, out] `mbstr`  \n Indirect pointer to the location of the multibyte character string to convert.  \n  \n [in] `count`  \n The maximum number of characters (not bytes) to convert and store in `wcstr`.  \n  \n [in, out] `mbstate`  \n A pointer to an `mbstate_t` conversion state object. If this value is a null pointer, a static internal conversion state object is used. Because the internal `mbstate_t` object is not thread-safe, we recommend that you always pass your own `mbstate` parameter.  \n  \n## Return Value  \n Returns the number of characters successfully converted, not including the terminating null character, if any. Returns (size_t)(-1) if an error occurred, and sets `errno` to EILSEQ.  \n  \n## Remarks  \n The `mbsrtowcs` function converts a string of multibyte characters indirectly pointed to by `mbstr`, into wide characters stored in the buffer pointed to by `wcstr`, by using the conversion state contained in `mbstate`. The conversion continues for each character until either a terminating null multibyte character is encountered, a multibyte sequence that does not correspond to a valid character in the current locale is encountered, or until `count` characters have been converted. If `mbsrtowcs` encounters the multibyte null character ('\\0') either before or when `count` occurs, it converts it to a 16-bit terminating null character and stops.  \n  \n Thus, the wide character string at `wcstr` is null-terminated only if `mbsrtowcs` encounters a multibyte null character during conversion. If the sequences pointed to by `mbstr` and `wcstr` overlap, the behavior of `mbsrtowcs` is undefined. `mbsrtowcs` is affected by the LC_TYPE category of the current locale.  \n  \n The `mbsrtowcs` function differs from [mbstowcs, _mbstowcs_l](../../c-runtime-library/reference/mbstowcs-mbstowcs-l.md) by its restartability. The conversion state is stored in `mbstate` for subsequent calls to the same or other restartable functions. Results are undefined when mixing the use of restartable and nonrestartable functions.  For example, an application should use `mbsrlen` instead of `mbslen`, if a subsequent call to `mbsrtowcs` is used instead of `mbstowcs.`  \n  \n If `wcstr` is not a null pointer, the pointer object pointed to by `mbstr` is assigned a null pointer if conversion stopped because a terminating null character was reached. Otherwise, it is assigned the address just past the last multibyte character converted, if any. This allows a subsequent function call to restart conversion where this call stopped.  \n  \n If the `wcstr` argument is a null pointer, the `count` argument is ignored and `mbsrtowcs` returns the required size in wide characters for the destination string. If `mbstate` is a null pointer, the function uses a non-thread-safe static internal `mbstate_t` conversion state object. If the character sequence `mbstr` does not have a corresponding multibyte character representation, a -1 is returned and the `errno` is set to `EILSEQ`.  \n  \n If `mbstr` isa null pointer, the invalid parameter handler is invoked, as described in [Parameter Validation](../../c-runtime-library/parameter-validation.md). If execution is allowed to continue, this function sets `errno` to `EINVAL` and returns -1.  \n  \n In C++, this function has a template overload that invokes the newer, secure counterpart of this function. For more information, see [Secure Template Overloads](../../c-runtime-library/secure-template-overloads.md).  \n  \n## Exceptions  \n The `mbsrtowcs` function is multithread safe as long as no function in the current thread calls `setlocale` as long as this function is executing and the `mbstate` argument is not a null pointer.  \n  \n## .NET Framework Equivalent  \n Not applicable. To call the standard C function, use `PInvoke`.
