The idea is to change the routing in one or more classes by overriding `OnCmdMsg` in those classes. Do so:  \n  \n-   In the class that breaks the order to pass to a nondefault object.  \n  \n-   In the new nondefault object or in command targets it might in turn pass commands to.  \n  \n If you insert some new object into the routing, its class must be a command-target class. In your overriding versions of `OnCmdMsg`, be sure to call the version that you're overriding. See the [OnCmdMsg](../mfc/reference/ccmdtarget-class.md#ccmdtarget__oncmdmsg) member function of class `CCmdTarget` in the *MFC Reference* and the versions in such classes as `CView` and **CDocument** in the supplied source code for examples.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [How the Framework Calls a Handler](../mfc/how-the-framework-calls-a-handler.md)\n\n"}
