These include:  \n  \n-   General-purpose time classes. The [CTime](../atl-mfc-shared/reference/ctime-class.md) and [CTimeSpan](../atl-mfc-shared/reference/ctimespan-class.md) classes encapsulate most of the functionality associated with the ANSI-standard time library, which is declared in TIME.H.  \n  \n-   Support for system clock. With MFC version 3.0, support was added to `CTime` for the Win32 `SYSTEMTIME` and `FILETIME` data types.  \n  \n-   Support for the Automation [DATE data type](../atl-mfc-shared/date-type.md). **DATE** supports date, time, and date/time values. The [COleDateTime](../atl-mfc-shared/reference/coledatetime-class.md) and [COleDateTimeSpan](../atl-mfc-shared/reference/coledatetimespan-class.md) classes encapsulate this functionality. They work with the [COleVariant](../mfc/reference/colevariant-class.md) class using Automation support.  \n  \n## What do you want to know more about  \n  \n-   [Date and Time: General-Purpose Classes](../atl-mfc-shared/date-and-time-general-purpose-classes.md)  \n  \n-   [Date and Time: SYSTEMTIME Support](../atl-mfc-shared/date-and-time-systemtime-support.md)  \n  \n-   [Date and Time: Automation Support](../atl-mfc-shared/date-and-time-automation-support.md)  \n  \n-   [Date and Time: Database Support](../atl-mfc-shared/date-and-time-database-support.md)  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Concepts](../mfc/mfc-concepts.md)   \n [General MFC Topics](../mfc/general-mfc-topics.md)\n\n"}
