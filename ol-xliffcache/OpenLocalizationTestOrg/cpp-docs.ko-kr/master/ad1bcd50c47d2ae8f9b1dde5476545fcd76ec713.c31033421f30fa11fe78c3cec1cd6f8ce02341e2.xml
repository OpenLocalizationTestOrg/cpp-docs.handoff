Class\nThis class implements a tear-off interface.  \n  \n## Syntax  \n  \n```\ntemplate<class Base>\nclass CComTearOffObject\n :  public Base\n```  \n  \n#### Parameters  \n `Base`  \n Your tear-off class, derived from `CComTearOffObjectBase` and the interfaces you want your tear-off object to support.  \n  \n ATL implements its tear-off interfaces in two phases — the `CComTearOffObjectBase` methods handle the reference count and `QueryInterface`, while `CComTearOffObject` implements [IUnknown](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms680509).  \n  \n## Members  \n  \n###

that is instantiated only when that interface is queried for. The tear-off is deleted when its reference count becomes zero. Typically, you build a tear-off interface for an interface that is rarely used, since using a tear-off saves a vtable pointer in all the instances of your main object.  \n  \n You should derive the class implementing the tear-off from `CComTearOffObjectBase` and from whichever interfaces you want your tear-off object to support. `CComTearOffObjectBase` is templatized on the owner class and the thread model. The owner class is the class of the object for which a tear-off is being implemented. If you do not specify a thread model, the default thread model is used.  \n  \n You should create a COM map for your tear-off class. When ATL instantiates the tear-off, it will create **CComTearOffObject\\<CYourTearOffClass>** or **CComCachedTearOffObject\\<CYourTearOffClass>**.  \n  \n For example, in the BEEPER sample, the `CBeeper2` class is the tear-off class and the `CBeeper` class is the owner class:  \n  \n [!code-cpp[NVC_ATL_COM#43](../../atl/codesnippet/cpp/ccomtearoffobject-class_1.h)]  \n  \n## Inheritance Hierarchy  \n `Base`  \n  \n `CComTearOffObject`  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Header:** atlcom.h  \n  \n##  <a name=\"ccomtearoffobject__addref\"></a>  CComTearOffObject::AddRef  \n Increments the reference count of the `CComTearOffObject` object by one.  \n  \n```\nSTDMETHOD_(ULONG, AddRef)();\n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n A value that may be useful for diagnostics and testing.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"ccomtearoffobject__ccomtearoffobject\"></a>  CComTearOffObject::CComTearOffObject  \n The constructor.  \n  \n```\nCComTearOffObject(void* pv);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `pv`  \n [in] Pointer that will be converted to a pointer to a **CComObject\\<Owner>** object.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n Increments the owner's reference count by one.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"ccomtearoffobject___dtorccomtearoffobject\"></a>  CComTearOffObject::~CComTearOffObject  \n The destructor.  \n  \n```\n~CComTearOffObject();\n```  \n  \n### Remarks  \n Frees all allocated resources, calls FinalRelease, and decrements the module lock count.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"ccomtearoffobject__ccomtearoffobjectbase\"></a>  CComTearOffObject::CComTearOffObjectBase  \n The constructor.  \n  \n```\nCComTearOffObjectBase();\n```  \n  \n### Remarks  \n Initializes the [m_pOwner](#ccomtearoffobject__m_powner) member to **NULL**.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"ccomtearoffobject__m_powner\"></a>  CComTearOffObject::m_pOwner  \n A pointer to a [CComObject](../../atl/reference/ccomobject-class.md) object derived from *Owner*.  \n  \n```\nCComObject<Owner>* m_pOwner;\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n *Owner*  \n [in] The class for which a tear-off is being implemented.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The pointer is initialized to **NULL** during construction.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"ccomtearoffobject__queryinterface\"></a>  CComTearOffObject::QueryInterface  \n Retrieves a pointer to the requested interface.  \n  \n```\nSTDMETHOD(QueryInterface)(REFIID iid,\n    void** ppvObject);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `iid`  \n [in] The IID of the interface being requested.  \n  \n `ppvObject`  \n [out] A pointer to the interface pointer identified by `iid`, or **NULL** if the interface is not found.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n A standard `HRESULT` value.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n Queries first for interfaces on your tear-off class.
