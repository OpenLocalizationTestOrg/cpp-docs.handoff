When there is more than one byte, previously read bytes are shifted left by the value of **CHAR_BIT** and the next byte is compared using the bitwise-OR operator with the low **CHAR_BIT** bits. The number of bytes in the multibyte character constant cannot exceed sizeof(int), which is 4 for 32-bit target code.  \n  \n The multibyte character constant is read as above and this is converted to a wide-character constant using the `mbtowc` run-time function. If the result is not a valid wide-character constant, an error is issued. In any event, the number of bytes examined by the `mbtowc` function is limited to the value of `MB_CUR_MAX`.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Characters](../c-language/characters.md)"}
