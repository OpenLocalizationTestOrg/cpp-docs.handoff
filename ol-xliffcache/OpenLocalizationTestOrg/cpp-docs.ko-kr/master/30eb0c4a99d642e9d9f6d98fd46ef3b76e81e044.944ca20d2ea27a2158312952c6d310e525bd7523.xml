The syntax of the **parallel for** directive is as follows:  \n  \n```  \n#pragma omp parallel for [clause[[,] clause] ...] new-linefor-loop  \n```  \n  \n This directive allows all the clauses of the **parallel** directive and the **for** directive, except the `nowait` clause, with identical meanings and restrictions. The semantics are identical to explicitly specifying a **parallel** directive immediately followed by a **for** directive.  \n  \n## Cross References:  \n  \n-   **parallel** directive, see [Section 2.3](../../parallel/openmp/2-3-parallel-construct.md) on page 8.  \n  \n-   **for** directive, see [Section 2.4.1](../../parallel/openmp/2-4-1-for-construct.md) on page 11.  \n  \n-   Data attribute clauses, see [2.7.2 Data-Sharing Attribute Clauses](../../parallel/openmp/2-7-2-data-sharing-attribute-clauses.md) on page 25."}
