# Compiler Warning (level 2) C4150
deletion of pointer to incomplete type 'type'; no destructor called  
  
 The **delete** operator is called to delete a type that was declared but not defined, so the compiler cannot find a destructor.  
  
 The following sample generates C4150:  
  
```  
// C4150.cpp  
// compile with: /W2  
class  IncClass;  
  
void NoDestruct( IncClass* pIncClass )  
{  
   delete pIncClass;  
} // C4150, define class to resolve  
  
int main()  
{  
}  
```
