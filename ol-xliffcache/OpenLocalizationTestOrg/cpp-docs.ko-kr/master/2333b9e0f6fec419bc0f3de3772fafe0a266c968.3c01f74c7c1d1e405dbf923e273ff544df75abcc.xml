user to associate different commands with a particular [CView](../../mfc/reference/cview-class.md) object when the user double-clicks inside that view.  \n  \n## Syntax  \n  \n```  \nclass CMouseManager : public CObject  \n```  \n  \n## Members  \n  \n### Public Methods  \n  \n|Name|Description|  \n|----------|-----------------|  \n|[CMouseManager::AddView](#cmousemanager__addview)|Adds a `CView` object to the **Customization** dialog box. The **Customization** dialog box enables the user to associate a double-click with a command for each of the listed views.|  \n|[CMouseManager::GetViewDblClickCommand](#cmousemanager__getviewdblclickcommand)|Returns the command that is executed when the user double-clicks inside the provided view.|  \n|[CMouseManager::GetViewIconId](#cmousemanager__getviewiconid)|Returns the icon associated with the provided view ID.|  \n|[CMouseManager::GetViewIdByName](#cmousemanager__getviewidbyname)|Returns the view ID associated with the provided view name.|  \n|[CMouseManager::GetViewNames](#cmousemanager__getviewnames)|Retrieves a list of all added view names.|  \n|[CMouseManager::LoadState](#cmousemanager__loadstate)|Loads the `CMouseManager` state from the Windows registry.|  \n|[CMouseManager::SaveState](#cmousemanager__savestate)|Writes the `CMouseManager` state to the Windows registry.|  \n|[CMouseManager::SetCommandForDblClk](#cmousemanager__setcommandfordblclk)|Associates the provided command and the provided view.|  \n  \n## Remarks  \n The `CMouseManager` class maintains a collection of `CView` objects. Each view is identified by a name and by an ID. These views are shown in the **Customization** dialog box. The user can change the command that is associated with any view through the **Customization** dialog box. The associated command is executed when the user double-clicks in that view. To support this from a coding perspective, you must process the `WM_LBUTTONDBLCLK` message and call the [CWinAppEx::OnViewDoubleClick](../../mfc/reference/cwinappex-class.md#cwinappex__onviewdoubleclick) function in the code for that `CView` object..  \n  \n You should not create a `CMouseManager` object manually. It will be created by the framework of your application. It will also be destroyed automatically when the user exits the application. To get a pointer to the mouse manager for your application, call [CWinAppEx::GetMouseManager](../../mfc/reference/cwinappex-class.md#cwinappex__getmousemanager).  \n  \n## Inheritance Hierarchy  \n [CObject](../../mfc/reference/cobject-class.md)  \n  \n [CMouseManager](../../mfc/reference/cmousemanager-class.md)  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Header:** afxmousemanager.h  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cmousemanager__addview\"></a>  CMouseManager::AddView  \n Registers a [CView](../../mfc/reference/cview-class.md) object with the [CMouseManager Class](../../mfc/reference/cmousemanager-class.md) to support custom mouse behavior.  \n  \n```  \nBOOL AddView(\n    int iViewId,  \n    UINT uiViewNameResId,  \n    UINT uiIconId = 0);\n\n \nBOOL AddView(\n    int iId,  \n    LPCTSTR lpszViewName,  \n    UINT uiIconId = 0);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n [in] `iViewId`  \n A view ID.  \n  \n [in] `uiViewNameResId`  \n A resource string ID that references the view name.  \n  \n [in] `uiIconId`  \n A view icon ID.  \n  \n [in] `iId`  \n A view ID.  \n  \n [in] `lpszViewName`  \n A view name.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Nonzero if successful; otherwise 0.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n In order to support custom mouse behavior, a view must be registered with the `CMouseManager` object. Any object derived from the `CView` class can be registered with the mouse manager. The string and icon associated with a view are displayed in the **Mouse** tab of the **Customize** dialog box.  \n  \n It is the responsibility of the programmer to create and maintain view IDs such as `iViewId` and `iId`.  \n  \n For more information about how to provide custom mouse behavior, see [Keyboard and Mouse Customization](../../mfc/keyboard-and-mouse-customization.md).  \n  \n### Example  \n The following example demonstrates how to retrieve a pointer to a `CMouseManager` object by using the `CWinAppEx::GetMouseManager` method and the `AddView` method in the `CMouseManager` class. This code snippet is part of the [State Collection sample](../../visual-cpp-samples.md).  \n  \n [!code-cpp[NVC_MFC_StateCollection#4](../../mfc/reference/codesnippet/cpp/cmousemanager-class_1.cpp)]  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cmousemanager__getviewdblclickcommand\"></a>  CMouseManager::GetViewDblClickCommand  \n Returns the command that is executed when the user double-clicks inside the provided view.  \n  \n```  \nUINT GetViewDblClickCommand(int iId) const;\n\n \n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n [in] `iId`  \n The view ID.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n The command identifier if the view is associated with a command; otherwise 0.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cmousemanager__getviewiconid\"></a>  CMouseManager::GetViewIconId  \n Retrieves the icon associated with a view ID.  \n  \n```  \nUINT GetViewIconId(int iViewId) const;\n\n \n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n [in] `iViewId`  \n The view ID.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n An icon resource identifier if successful; otherwise 0.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n This method will fail if the view is not first registered by using [CMouseManager::AddView](#cmousemanager__addview).  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cmousemanager__getviewidbyname\"></a>  CMouseManager::GetViewIdByName  \n Retrieves the view ID associated with a view name.  \n  \n```  \nint GetViewIdByName(LPCTSTR lpszName) const;\n\n \n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n [in] `lpszName`  \n The view name.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n A view ID if successful; otherwise 0.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n This method searches through views registered by using [CMouseManager::AddView](#cmousemanager__addview).  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cmousemanager__getviewnames\"></a>  CMouseManager::GetViewNames  \n Retrieves a list of all the registered view names.  \n  \n```  \nvoid GetViewNames(CStringList& listOfNames) const;\n\n \n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n [out] `listOfNames`  \n A reference to `CStringList` object.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n This method fills the parameter `listOfNames` with the names of all the views registered by using [CMouseManager::AddView](#cmousemanager__addview).  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cmousemanager__loadstate\"></a>  CMouseManager::LoadState  \n Loads the state of the [CMouseManager Class](../../mfc/reference/cmousemanager-class.md) from the registry.  \n  \n```  \nBOOL LoadState(LPCTSTR lpszProfileName = NULL);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n [in] `lpszProfileName`  \n A path of a registry key.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Nonzero if successful; otherwise 0.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The state information loaded from the registry includes the registered views, view identifiers, and the associated commands. If the parameter `lpszProfileName` is `NULL`, this function loads the `CMouseManager` data from the default registry location controlled by the [CWinAppEx Class](../../mfc/reference/cwinappex-class.md).  \n  \n In most cases, you do not have to call this function directly. It is called as a part of the workspace initialization process. For more information about the workspace initialization process, see [CWinAppEx::LoadState](../../mfc/reference/cwinappex-class.md#cwinappex__loadstate).  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cmousemanager__savestate\"></a>  CMouseManager::SaveState  \n Writes the state of the [CMouseManager Class](../../mfc/reference/cmousemanager-class.md) to the registry.  \n  \n```  \nBOOL SaveState(LPCTSTR lpszProfileName = NULL);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n [in] `lpszProfileName`  \n A path of a registry key.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Nonzero if successful; otherwise 0.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The state information written to the registry includes all registered views, view identifiers, and the associated commands. If the parameter `lpszProfileName` is `NULL`, this function writes the `CMouseManager` data to the default registry location controlled by the [CWinAppEx Class](../../mfc/reference/cwinappex-class.md).  \n  \n In most cases, you do not have to call this function directly. It is called as a part of the workspace serialization process. For more information about the workspace serialization process, see [CWinAppEx::SaveState](../../mfc/reference/cwinappex-class.md#cwinappex__savestate).  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cmousemanager__setcommandfordblclk\"></a>  CMouseManager::SetCommandForDblClk  \n Associates a custom command with a view that is first registered with the mouse manager.  \n  \n```  \nvoid SetCommandForDblClk(\n    int iViewId,  \n    UINT uiCmd);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n [in] `iViewId`  \n The view identifier.  \n  \n [in] `uiCmd`  \n The command identifier.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n In order to associate a custom command with a view, you must first register the view by using [CMouseManager::AddView](#cmousemanager__addview). The `AddView` method requires a view identifier as an input parameter. Once you register a view, you can call `CMouseManager::SetCommandForDblClk` with the same view identifier input parameter that you supplied to `AddView`. Thereafter, when the user double-clicks the mouse in the registered view, the application will execute the command indicated by `uiCmd.` To support the custom mouse behavior, you will also need to customize the view registered with the mouse manager. For more information about custom mouse behavior, see [Keyboard and Mouse Customization]--brokenlink--(../mouse-and-keyboard-customization.md).  \n  \n If `uiCmd` is set to 0, the specified view is no longer associated with a command.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Hierarchy Chart](../../mfc/hierarchy-chart.md)   \n [Classes](../../mfc/reference/mfc-classes.md)   \n [CWinAppEx Class](../../mfc/reference/cwinappex-class.md)   \n [Keyboard and Mouse Customization](../../mfc/keyboard-and-mouse-customization.md)\n\n\n\n"}
