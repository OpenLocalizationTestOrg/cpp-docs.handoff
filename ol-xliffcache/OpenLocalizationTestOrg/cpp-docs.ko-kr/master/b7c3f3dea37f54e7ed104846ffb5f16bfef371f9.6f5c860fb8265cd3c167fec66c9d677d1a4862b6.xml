This is useful for accessing static elements in the .NET Framework because, during shutdown, these constructs are finalized by the system and cannot be reliably used. By checking the <xref:System.Environment.HasShutdownStarted%2A> property first, you can avoid potential failures by not accessing these elements.  \n  \n## Example  \n  \n```  \n// check_shutdown.cpp  \n// compile with: /clr  \nusing namespace System;  \nint main()   \n{  \n   if (Environment::HasShutdownStarted)  \n      Console::WriteLine(\"Shutting down.\");  \n   else  \n      Console::WriteLine(\"Not shutting down.\");  \n   return 0;  \n}  \n```  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Windows Operations (C++/CLI)](../dotnet/windows-operations-cpp-cli.md)   \n [.NET Programming with C++/CLI (Visual C++)](../dotnet/dotnet-programming-with-cpp-cli-visual-cpp.md)"}
