A rich edit control supports this so-called \"bottomless\" functionality by sending its parent window an [EN_REQUESTRESIZE](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb787983) notification message whenever the size of its contents changes.  \n  \n When processing the **EN_REQUESTRESIZE** notification message, an application should resize the control to the dimensions in the specified [REQRESIZE](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb787950) structure. An application might also move any information near the control to accommodate the control's change in height. To resize the control, you can use the `CWnd` function [SetWindowPos](../mfc/reference/cwnd-class.md#cwnd__setwindowpos).  \n  \n You can force a bottomless rich edit control to send an **EN_REQUESTRESIZE** notification message by using the [RequestResize](../mfc/reference/cricheditctrl-class.md#cricheditctrl__requestresize) member function. This message can be useful in the [OnSize](../mfc/reference/cwnd-class.md#cwnd__onsize) handler.  \n  \n To receive **EN_REQUESTRESIZE** notification messages, you must enable the notification by using the `SetEventMask` member function.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Using CRichEditCtrl](../mfc/using-cricheditctrl.md)   \n [Controls](../mfc/controls-mfc.md)\n\n"}
