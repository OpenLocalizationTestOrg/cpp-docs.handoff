This means that functions that cannot be written in C or C++ will either have to be written as subroutines or as intrinsic functions supported by the compiler. Certain functions are performance sensitive while others are not. Performance-sensitive functions should be implemented as intrinsic functions.  \n  \n The intrinsics supported by the compiler are described in [Compiler Intrinsics](../intrinsics/compiler-intrinsics.md).  \n  \n## See Also  \n [x64 Software Conventions](../build/x64-software-conventions.md)"}
