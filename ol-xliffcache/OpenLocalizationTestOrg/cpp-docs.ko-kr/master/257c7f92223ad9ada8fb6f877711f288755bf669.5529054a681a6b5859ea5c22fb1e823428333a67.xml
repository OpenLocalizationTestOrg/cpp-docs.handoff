fwscanf_s, _fwscanf_s_l\nReads formatted data from a stream. These versions of [fscanf, _fscanf_l, fwscanf, _fwscanf_l](../../c-runtime-library/reference/fscanf-fscanf-l-fwscanf-fwscanf-l.md) have security enhancements, as described in [Security Features in the CRT](../../c-runtime-library/security-features-in-the-crt.md).  \n  \n## Syntax  \n  \n```  \nint fscanf_s(   \n   FILE *stream,  \n   const char *format [,  \n   argument ]...   \n);  \nint _fscanf_s_l(   \n   FILE *stream,  \n   const char *format,  \n   locale_t locale [,  \n   argument ]...   \n);  \nint fwscanf_s(   \n   FILE *stream,  \n   const wchar_t *format [,  \n   argument ]...   \n);  \nint _fwscanf_s_l(   \n   FILE *stream,  \n   const wchar_t *format,  \n   locale_t locale [,  \n   argument ]...   \n);  \n```  \n  \n#### Parameters  \n `stream`  \n Pointer to `FILE` structure.  \n  \n `format`  \n Format-control string.  \n  \n `argument`  \n Optional arguments.  \n  \n `locale`  \n The locale to use.  \n  \n## Return Value  \n Each of these functions returns the number of fields that are successfully converted and assigned; the return value does not include fields that were read but not assigned. A return value of 0 indicates that no fields were assigned. If an error occurs, or if the end of the file stream is reached before the first conversion, the return value is `EOF` for `fscanf_s` and `fwscanf_s`.  \n  \n These functions validate their parameters. If `stream` is an invalid file pointer, or `format` is a null pointer, these functions invoke the invalid parameter handler, as described in [Parameter Validation](../../c-runtime-library/parameter-validation.md). If execution is allowed to continue, these functions return `EOF` and set `errno` to `EINVAL`.  \n  \n## Remarks  \n The `fscanf_s` function reads data from the current position of `stream` into the locations that are given by `argument` (if any). Each `argument` must be a pointer to a variable of a type that corresponds to a type specifier in `format`. `format` controls the interpretation of the input fields and has the same form and function as the `format` argument for `scanf_s`; see [Format Specification Fields: scanf and wscanf Functions](../../c-runtime-library/format-specification-fields-scanf-and-wscanf-functions.md) for a description of `format`.  `fwscanf_s` is a wide-character version of `fscanf_s`; the format argument to `fwscanf_s` is a wide-character string. These functions behave identically if the stream is opened in ANSI mode. `fscanf_s` doesn't currently support input from a UNICODE stream.  \n  \n The main difference between the more secure functions (that have the `_s` suffix) and the other versions is that the more secure functions require the size in characters of each `c`, `C`, `s`, `S`, and `[` type field to be passed as an argument immediately following the variable. For more information, see [scanf_s, _scanf_s_l, wscanf_s, _wscanf_s_l](../../c-runtime-library/reference/scanf-s-scanf-s-l-wscanf-s-wscanf-s-l.md) and [scanf Width Specification](../../c-runtime-library/scanf-width-specification.md).  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The size parameter is of type `unsigned`, not `size_t`.  \n  \n The versions of these functions that have the `_l` suffix are identical except that they use the locale parameter that's passed in instead of the current thread locale.  \n  \n### Generic-Text Routine Mappings  \n  \n|TCHAR.H routine|_UNICODE & _MBCS not defined|_MBCS defined|_UNICODE defined|  \n|---------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|  \n|`_ftscanf_s`|`fscanf_s`|`fscanf_s`|`fwscanf_s`|  \n|`_ftscanf_s_l`|`_fscanf_s_l`|`_fscanf_s_l`|`_fwscanf_s_l`|  \n  \n## Requirements  \n  \n|Function|Required header|  \n|--------------|---------------------|  \n|`fscanf_s`, `_fscanf_s_l`|\\<stdio.h>|  \n|`fwscanf_s`, `_fwscanf_s_l`|\\<stdio.h> or \\<wchar.h>|  \n  \n For additional compatibility information, see [Compatibility](../../c-runtime-library/compatibility.md).  \n  \n## Example  \n  \n```  \n// crt_fscanf_s.c  \n// This program writes formatted  \n// data to a file.
