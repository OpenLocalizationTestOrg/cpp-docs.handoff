These conversions are performed independently on each argument in the call. This means that a **float** value is converted to a **double**; a `char` or **short** value is converted to an `int`; and an `unsigned char` or **unsigned short** is converted to an `unsigned int`.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Type Conversions](../c-language/type-conversions-c.md)"}
