If both operands are arithmetic, or both are nonarithmetic (such as array or pointer), they are used without change. If one operand is arithmetic and the other is not, the arithmetic operand is converted to the type of the nonarithmetic operand.  \n  \n This sample generates C2040 and shows how to fix it.  \n  \n```  \n// C2040.cpp  \n// Compile by using: cl /c /W3 C2040.cpp  \nbool test() {  \n   char c = '3';  \n   return c == \"3\"; // C2446, C2040  \n   // return c == '3'; // OK  \n}  \n```"}
