This is only useful for propagator blocks, which derive from source_block  \n  \n```\nvirtual void process_input_messages(_Inout_ message<_Target_type>* _PMessage);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `_PMessage`  \n  \n##  <a name=\"propagate_output_messages\"></a>  source_block::propagate_output_messages Method  \n Propagate messages to targets.  \n  \n```\nvirtual void propagate_output_messages();\n```  \n  \n##  <a name=\"propagate_to_any_targets\"></a>  source_block::propagate_to_any_targets Method  \n When overridden in a derived class, propagates the given message to any or all of the linked targets. This is the main propagation routine for message blocks.  \n  \n```\nvirtual void propagate_to_any_targets(_Inout_opt_ message<_Target_type>* _PMessage);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `_PMessage`  \n A pointer to the message that is to be propagated.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"release\"></a>  source_block::release Method  \n Releases a previous successful message reservation.  \n  \n```\nvirtual void release(\n    runtime_object_identity _MsgId,\n    _Inout_ ITarget<_Target_type>* _PTarget);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `_MsgId`  \n The `runtime_object_identity` of the reserved `message` object.  \n  \n `_PTarget`  \n A pointer to the target block that is calling the `release` method.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The method throws an [invalid_argument](../../../standard-library/invalid-argument-class.md) exception if the parameter `_PTarget` is `NULL`.  \n  \n The method throws a [bad_target](bad-target-class.md) exception if the parameter `_PTarget` does not represent the target that called `reserve`.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"release_message\"></a>  source_block::release_message Method  \n When overridden in a derived class, releases a previous message reservation.  \n  \n```\nvirtual void release_message(runtime_object_identity _MsgId) = 0;\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `_MsgId`  \n The `runtime_object_identity` of the `message` object being released.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"release_ref\"></a>  source_block::release_ref Method  \n Releases a reference count on this `source_block` object.  \n  \n```\nvirtual void release_ref(_Inout_ ITarget<_Target_type>* _PTarget);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `_PTarget`  \n A pointer to the target block that is calling this method.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n This method is called by an `ITarget` object that is being unlinked from this source. The source block is allowed to release any resources reserved for the target block.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"remove_targets\"></a>  source_block::remove_targets Method  \n Removes all target links for this source block. This should be called from the destructor.  \n  \n```\nvoid remove_targets();\n```  \n  \n##  <a name=\"reserve\"></a>  source_block::reserve Method  \n Reserves a message previously offered by this `source_block` object.  \n  \n```\nvirtual bool reserve(\n    runtime_object_identity _MsgId,\n    _Inout_ ITarget<_Target_type>* _PTarget);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `_MsgId`  \n The `runtime_object_identity` of the offered `message` object.  \n  \n `_PTarget`  \n A pointer to the target block that is calling the `reserve` method.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n `true` if the message was successfully reserved, `false` otherwise.
