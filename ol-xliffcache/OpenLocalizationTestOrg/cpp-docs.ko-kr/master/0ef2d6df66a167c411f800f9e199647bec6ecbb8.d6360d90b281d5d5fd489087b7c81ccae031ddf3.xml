Many data classes need to be serialized to files, so it's often a good idea to derive them from `CObject`. For an example of a class derived from `CObject`, see the [Scribble sample](../visual-cpp-samples.md).  \n  \n## See Also  \n [CObject Class: Frequently Asked Questions](../mfc/cobject-class-frequently-asked-questions.md)\n"}
