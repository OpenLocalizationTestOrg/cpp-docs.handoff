A type is used when you're calling through a function-pointer.  \n  \n To call a managed function from a native context, you can add a \"wrapper\" function that will call the `__clrcall` function. Or, you can use the CLR marshalling mechanism; see [How to: Marshal Function Pointers Using PInvoke](../../dotnet/how-to-marshal-function-pointers-using-pinvoke.md) for more information.  \n  \n The following sample generates C3642:  \n  \n```  \n// C3642.cpp  \n// compile with: /clr  \nusing namespace System;  \nstruct S {  \n   void Test(String ^ s) {   // CLR type in signature, implicitly __clrcall  \n      Console::WriteLine(s);  \n   }  \n   void Test2(char * s) {  \n      Test(gcnew String(s));  \n   }  \n};  \n  \n#pragma unmanaged  \nint main() {  \n   S s;  \n   s.Test(\"abc\");   // C3642  \n   s.Test2(\"abc\");   // OK  \n}  \n```"}
