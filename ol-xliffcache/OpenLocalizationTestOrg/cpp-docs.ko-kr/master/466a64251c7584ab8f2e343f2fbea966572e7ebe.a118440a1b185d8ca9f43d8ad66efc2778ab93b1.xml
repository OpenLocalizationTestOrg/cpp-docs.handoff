Data files are usually processed in text mode. To control the file translation mode, one can:  \n  \n-   Retain the current default setting and specify the alternative mode only when you open selected files.  \n  \n-   Use the function [_set_fmode](../c-runtime-library/reference/set-fmode.md) to change the default mode for newly opened files. Use [_get_fmode](../c-runtime-library/reference/get-fmode.md) to find the current default mode. The initial default setting is text mode (`_O_TEXT`).  \n  \n-   Change the default translation mode directly by setting the global variable [_fmode](../c-runtime-library/fmode.md) in your program. The function `_set_fmode` sets the value of this variable, but it can also be set directly.  \n  \n When you call a file-open function such as [_open](../c-runtime-library/reference/open-wopen.md), [fopen](../c-runtime-library/reference/fopen-wfopen.md), [fopen_s](../c-runtime-library/reference/fopen-s-wfopen-s.md), [freopen](../c-runtime-library/reference/freopen-wfreopen.md), [freopen_s](../c-runtime-library/reference/freopen-s-wfreopen-s.md), [_fsopen](../c-runtime-library/reference/fsopen-wfsopen.md) or [_sopen_s](../c-runtime-library/reference/sopen-s-wsopen-s.md), you can override the current default setting of `_fmode` by specifying the appropriate argument to the function [_set_fmode](../c-runtime-library/reference/set-fmode.md). The `stdin`, `stdout`, and `stderr` streams always open in text mode by default; you can also override this default when opening any of these files. Use [_setmode](../c-runtime-library/reference/setmode.md) to change the translation mode using the file descriptor after the file is open.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Input and Output](../c-runtime-library/input-and-output.md)   \n [Run-Time Routines by Category](../c-runtime-library/run-time-routines-by-category.md)"}
