C programmers will be familiar with many of these concepts, but there are some subtle differences that can cause unexpected program results. The following topics are included:  \n  \n-   [Declarations and definitions](../cpp/declarations-and-definitions-cpp.md)  \n  \n-   [Scope of a C++ object or function](../cpp/scope-visual-cpp.md)  \n  \n-   [Program definition and linkage rules](../cpp/program-and-linkage-cpp.md)  \n  \n-   [Startup and termination](../cpp/startup-and-termination-cpp.md)  \n  \n-   [L-values and r-values](../cpp/lvalues-and-rvalues-visual-cpp.md)  \n  \n-   [Temporary Objects](../cpp/temporary-objects.md)  \n  \n-   [Alignment](../cpp/alignment-cpp-declarations.md)  \n  \n-   [alignof and alignas](../cpp/alignof-and-alignas-cpp.md)  \n  \n-   [Trivial, standard-layout and POD types](../cpp/trivial-standard-layout-and-pod-types.md)  \n  \n## See Also  \n [C++ Language Reference](../cpp/cpp-language-reference.md)"}
