Also, you can open a bitmap file and save it as a GIF or JPEG. Images you work with need not be part of a project for editing in the development environment (see [stand-alone image editing](../mfc/editing-an-image-outside-of-a-project-image-editor-for-icons.md)).  \n  \n### To convert an image from one format to another  \n  \n1.  Open the image in the **Image** editor.  \n  \n2.  From the **File** menu, choose **Save *filename* As**.  \n  \n3.  In the **Save File As** dialog box, in the **File name** box, type the file name and the extension that denotes the format you want.  \n  \n4.  Click **Save**.  \n  \n For information on adding resources to managed projects, please see [Resources in Applications](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/8ad495d4-2941-40cf-bf64-e82e85825890) in the *.NET Framework Developer's Guide.* For information on manually adding resource files to managed projects, accessing resources, displaying static resources, and assigning resources strings to properties, see [Walkthrough: Localizing Windows Forms](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/9a96220d-a19b-4de0-9f48-01e5d82679e5) and [Walkthrough: Using Resources for Localization with ASP.NET](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/bb4e5b44-e2b0-48ab-bbe9-609fb33900b6).  \n  \n Requirements  \n  \n None  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Editing Graphical Resources](../mfc/editing-graphical-resources-image-editor-for-icons.md)   \n [Image Editor for Icons](../mfc/image-editor-for-icons.md)\n\n"}
