They allow data to be transferred between applications by using the Clipboard or through drag and drop.  \n  \n [COleDropSource](../mfc/reference/coledropsource-class.md)  \n Controls the drag-and-drop operation from start to finish. This class determines when the drag operation starts and when it ends. It also displays cursor feedback during the drag-and-drop operation.  \n  \n [COleDataSource](../mfc/reference/coledatasource-class.md)  \n Used when an application provides data for a data transfer. `COleDataSource` could be viewed as an object-oriented Clipboard object.  \n  \n [COleDropTarget](../mfc/reference/coledroptarget-class.md)  \n Represents the target of a drag-and-drop operation. A `COleDropTarget` object corresponds to a window on screen. It determines whether to accept any data dropped onto it and implements the actual drop operation.  \n  \n [COleDataObject](../mfc/reference/coledataobject-class.md)  \n Used as the receiver side to `COleDataSource`. `COleDataObject` objects provide access to the data stored by a `COleDataSource` object.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Class Overview](../mfc/class-library-overview.md)\n\n"}
