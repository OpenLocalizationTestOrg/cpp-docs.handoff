For more information on this procedure, see [Adding a Member Variable](../ide/adding-a-member-variable-visual-cpp.md).  \n  \n Once you have added the member variable a class, referred to as a wrapper class, is automatically generated and added to your project. This class is used as an interface between the control container and the embedded control.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [ActiveX Control Containers](../mfc/activex-control-containers.md)\n\n"}
