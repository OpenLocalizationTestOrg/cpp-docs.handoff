Because all transitions are cleared automatically, it's recommended to allocated them using operator new. The encapsulated IUIAnimationTransition COM object is created by CAnimationController::AnimateGroup, until then it's NULL. Changing member variables after creation of this COM object has no effect.  \n  \n## Inheritance Hierarchy  \n [CObject](../../mfc/reference/cobject-class.md)  \n  \n [CBaseTransition](../../mfc/reference/cbasetransition-class.md)  \n  \n [CDiscreteTransition](../../mfc/reference/cdiscretetransition-class.md)  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Header:** afxanimationcontroller.h  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cdiscretetransition__cdiscretetransition\"></a>  CDiscreteTransition::CDiscreteTransition  \n Constructs a discrete transition object and initializes its parameters.  \n  \n```  \nCDiscreteTransition(\n    UI_ANIMATION_SECONDS delay,  \n    DOUBLE dblFinalValue,  \n    UI_ANIMATION_SECONDS hold);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `delay`  \n The amount of time by which to delay the instantaneous switch to the final value.  \n  \n `dblFinalValue`  \n The value of the animation variable at the end of the transition.  \n  \n `hold`  \n The amount of time by which to hold the variable at its final value.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cdiscretetransition__create\"></a>  CDiscreteTransition::Create  \n Calls the transition library to create encapsulated transition COM object.  \n  \n```  \nvirtual BOOL Create(\n    IUIAnimationTransitionLibrary* pLibrary,  \n    IUIAnimationTransitionFactory* */);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `pLibrary`  \n A pointer to transition library, which is responsible for creation of standard transitions.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n TRUE if transition is created successfully; otherwise FALSE.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cdiscretetransition__m_dblfinalvalue\"></a>  CDiscreteTransition::m_dblFinalValue  \n The value of the animation variable at the end of the transition.  \n  \n```  \nDOUBLE m_dblFinalValue;  \n```  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cdiscretetransition__m_delay\"></a>  CDiscreteTransition::m_delay  \n The amount of time by which to delay the instantaneous switch to the final value.  \n  \n```  \nUI_ANIMATION_SECONDS m_delay;  \n```  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cdiscretetransition__m_hold\"></a>  CDiscreteTransition::m_hold  \n The amount of time by which to hold the variable at its final value.  \n  \n```  \nUI_ANIMATION_SECONDS m_hold;  \n```  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Classes](../../mfc/reference/mfc-classes.md)\n"}
