One image list contains full-sized icons used in icon view. A second, optional, image list contains smaller versions of the same icons for use in other views of the control. A third optional list contains \"state\" images, such as check boxes, for display in front of the small icons in certain views. A fourth optional list contains images that are displayed in individual header items of the list control.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  If a list view control is created with the `LVS_SHAREIMAGELISTS` style, you are responsible for destroying the image lists when they are no longer in use. Specify this style if you assign the same image lists to multiple list view controls; otherwise, more than one control might try to destroy the same image list.  \n  \n For more information about list items, see [List View Image Lists](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb774736) and [Items and Subitems](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb774736) in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../atl/includes/winsdk_md.md)]. Also see class [CImageList](../mfc/reference/cimagelist-class.md) in the *MFC Reference* and [Using CImageList](../mfc/using-cimagelist.md) in this family of articles.  \n  \n To create a list control, you need to supply image lists to be used when you insert new items into the list. The following example demonstrates this procedure, where `m_pImagelist` is a pointer of type `CImageList` and `m_listctrl` is a `CListCtrl` data member.  \n  \n [!code-cpp[NVC_MFCControlLadenDialog#19](../mfc/codesnippet/cpp/list-items-and-image-lists_1.cpp)]  \n  \n However, if you don't plan to display icons in your list view or list control, you don't need image lists.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Using CListCtrl](../mfc/using-clistctrl.md)   \n [Controls](../mfc/controls-mfc.md)\n\n"}
