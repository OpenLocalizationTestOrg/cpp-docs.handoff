You can use list controls:  \n  \n-   Directly, by embedding a [CListCtrl](../mfc/reference/clistctrl-class.md) object in a dialog class.  \n  \n-   Indirectly, by using class [CListView](../mfc/reference/clistview-class.md).  \n  \n `CListView` makes it easy to integrate a list control with the MFC document/view architecture, encapsulating the control much as [CEditView](../mfc/reference/ceditview-class.md) encapsulates an edit control: the control fills the entire surface area of an MFC view. (The view *is* the control, cast to `CListView`.)  \n  \n A `CListView` object inherits from [CCtrlView](../mfc/reference/cctrlview-class.md) and its base classes and adds a member function to retrieve the underlying list control. Use view members to work with the view as a view. Use the [GetListCtrl](../mfc/reference/clistview-class.md#clistview__getlistctrl) member function to gain access to the list control's member functions. Use these members to:  \n  \n-   Add, delete, or manipulate \"items\" in the list.  \n  \n-   Set or get list control attributes.  \n  \n To obtain a reference to the `CListCtrl` underlying a `CListView`, call `GetListCtrl` from your list view class:  \n  \n [!code-cpp[NVC_MFCListView#4](../atl/reference/codesnippet/cpp/list-control-and-list-view_1.cpp)]  \n  \n This topic describes both ways to use the list control.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Using CListCtrl](../mfc/using-clistctrl.md)   \n [Controls](../mfc/controls-mfc.md)\n\n"}
