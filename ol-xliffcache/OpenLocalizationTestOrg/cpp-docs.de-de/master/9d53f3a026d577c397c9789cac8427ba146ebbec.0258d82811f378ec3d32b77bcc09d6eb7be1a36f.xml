In [Resource View](../windows/resource-view-window.md), right-click your .rc file and choose [Resource Includes](../windows/resource-includes-dialog-box.md) from the shortcut menu.  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  If your project doesn't already contain an .rc file, please see [Creating a New Resource Script File](../windows/how-to-create-a-resource-script-file.md).  \n  \n2.  In the **Symbol header file** box, type the new name for the include file.  \n  \n For information on adding resources to managed projects, please see [Resources in Applications](http://msdn.microsoft.com/Library/8ad495d4-2941-40cf-bf64-e82e85825890) in the *.NET Framework Developer's Guide.*  \n  \n Requirements  \n  \n Win32  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Viewing Resource Symbols](../windows/viewing-resource-symbols.md)   \n [Predefined Symbol IDs](../windows/predefined-symbol-ids.md)"}
