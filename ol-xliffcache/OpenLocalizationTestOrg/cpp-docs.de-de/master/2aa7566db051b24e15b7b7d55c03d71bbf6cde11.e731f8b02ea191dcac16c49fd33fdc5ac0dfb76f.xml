When you compile the project, an error message indicates what the problem is and where it occurred.  \n  \n## Prerequisites  \n  \n-   This walkthrough assumes that you understand the fundamentals of the C++ language.  \n  \n-   It also assumes that you have completed the earlier related walkthroughs that are listed in [Using the Visual Studio IDE for C++ Desktop Development](../ide/using-the-visual-studio-ide-for-cpp-desktop-development.md).  \n  \n### To fix compilation errors  \n  \n1.  In TestGames.cpp, delete the semicolon in the last line so that it resembles this:  \n  \n     `return 0`  \n  \n2.  On the menu bar, choose **Build**, **Build Solution**.  \n  \n3.  A message in the **Error List** window indicates that there was an error in the building of the project. The description looks something like this:  \n  \n     `error C2143: syntax error : missing ';' before '}'`  \n  \n     To view help information about this error, highlight it in the **Error List** window and then choose the F1 key.  \n  \n4.  Add the semicolon back to the end of the line that has the syntax error:  \n  \n     `return 0;`  \n  \n5.  On the menu bar, choose **Build**, **Build Solution**.  \n  \n     A message in the **Output** window indicates that the project compiled successfully.  \n  \n    ```Output  \n    1>------ Build started: Project: Game, Configuration: Debug Win32 ------  \n    1>  TestGames.cpp  \n    1>  Game.vcxproj -> C:\\Users\\<username>\\Documents\\Visual Studio <version>\\Projects\\Game\\Debug\\Game.exe  \n    ========== Build: 1 succeeded, 0 failed, 0 up-to-date, 0 skipped ==========  \n    ```  \n  \n## Next Steps  \n **Previous:** [Walkthrough: Working with Projects and Solutions (C++)](../ide/walkthrough-working-with-projects-and-solutions-cpp.md) &#124; **Next:**[Walkthrough: Testing a Project (C++)](../ide/walkthrough-testing-a-project-cpp.md)  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Visual C++ Guided Tour](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/499cb66f-7df1-45d6-8b6b-33d94fd1f17c)   \n [DELETE_PENDING_Building and Debugging](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/9f6ba537-5ea0-46fb-b6ba-b63d657d84f1)"}
