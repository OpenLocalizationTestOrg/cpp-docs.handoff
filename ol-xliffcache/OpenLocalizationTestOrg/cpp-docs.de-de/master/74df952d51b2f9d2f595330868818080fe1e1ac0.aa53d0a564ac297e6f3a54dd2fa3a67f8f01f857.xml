After the result is obtained, the value of the operand is incremented (or decremented). The following code illustrates the postfix increment operator.  \n  \n```  \nif( var++ > 0 )  \n    *p++ = *q++;  \n```  \n  \n In this example, the variable `var` is compared to 0, then incremented. If `var` was positive before being incremented, the next statement is executed. First, the value of the object pointed to by `q` is assigned to the object pointed to by `p`. Then, `q` and `p` are incremented.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Postfix Increment and Decrement Operators: ++ and --](../cpp/postfix-increment-and-decrement-operators-increment-and-decrement.md)"}
