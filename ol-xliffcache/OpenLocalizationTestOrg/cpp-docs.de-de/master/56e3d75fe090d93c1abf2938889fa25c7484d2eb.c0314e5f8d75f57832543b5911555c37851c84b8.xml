Image lists are used to efficiently manage large sets of icons or bitmaps. Image lists are not themselves controls since they are not windows; however, they are used with several different types of controls, including list controls ([CListCtrl](../mfc/reference/clistctrl-class.md)), tree controls ([CTreeCtrl](../mfc/reference/ctreectrl-class.md)), and tab controls ([CTabCtrl](../mfc/reference/ctabctrl-class.md)).  \n  \n All images in an image list are contained in a single, wide bitmap in screen-device format. An image list may also include a monochrome bitmap that contains masks used to draw images transparently (icon style). `CImageList` provides member functions that enable you to draw images, create and destroy image lists, add and remove images, replace images, merge images, and drag images.  \n  \n## What do you want to know more about  \n  \n-   [Types of Image Lists](../mfc/types-of-image-lists.md)  \n  \n-   [Using an Image List](../mfc/using-an-image-list.md)  \n  \n-   [Manipulating Image Lists](../mfc/manipulating-image-lists.md)  \n  \n-   [Drawing Images from an Image List](../mfc/drawing-images-from-an-image-list.md)  \n  \n-   [Image Overlays in Image Lists](../mfc/image-overlays-in-image-lists.md)  \n  \n-   [Dragging Images from an Image List](../mfc/dragging-images-from-an-image-list.md)  \n  \n-   [Image Information in Image Lists](../mfc/image-information-in-image-lists.md)  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Controls](../mfc/controls-mfc.md)\n\n"}
