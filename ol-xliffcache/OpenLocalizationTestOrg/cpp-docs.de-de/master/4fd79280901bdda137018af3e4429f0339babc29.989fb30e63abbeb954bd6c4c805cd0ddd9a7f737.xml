`CPaintDC` object, prepares the application window for painting, and stores the [PAINTSTRUCT](../../mfc/reference/paintstruct-structure.md) structure in the [m_ps](#cpaintdc__m_ps) member variable.  \n  \n```  \nexplicit CPaintDC(CWnd* pWnd);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `pWnd`  \n Points to the `CWnd` object to which the `CPaintDC` object belongs.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n An exception (of type `CResourceException`) is thrown if the Windows [GetDC](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd144871) call fails. A device context may not be available if Windows has already allocated all of its available device contexts. Your application competes for the five common display contexts available at any given time under Windows.  \n  \n### Example  \n [!code-cpp[NVC_MFCDocView#97](../../mfc/codesnippet/cpp/cpaintdc-class_1.cpp)]  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cpaintdc__m_hwnd\"></a>  CPaintDC::m_hWnd  \n The `HWND` to which this `CPaintDC` object is attached.  \n  \n```  \nHWND m_hWnd;  \n```  \n  \n### Remarks  \n `m_hWnd` is a protected variable of type `HWND`.  \n  \n### Example  \n [!code-cpp[NVC_MFCDocView#98](../../mfc/codesnippet/cpp/cpaintdc-class_2.cpp)]  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cpaintdc__m_ps\"></a>  CPaintDC::m_ps  \n `m_ps` is a public member variable of type [PAINTSTRUCT](../../mfc/reference/paintstruct-structure.md).  \n  \n```  \nPAINTSTRUCT m_ps;  \n```  \n  \n### Remarks  \n It is the `PAINTSTRUCT` that is passed to and filled out by [CWnd::BeginPaint](../../mfc/reference/cwnd-class.md#cwnd__beginpaint).  \n  \n The `PAINTSTRUCT` contains information that the application uses to paint the client area of the window associated with a `CPaintDC` object.  \n  \n Note that you can access the device-context handle through the `PAINTSTRUCT`. However, you can access the handle more directly through the `m_hDC` member variable that `CPaintDC` inherits from `CDC`.  \n  \n### Example  \n  See the example for [CPaintDC::m_hWnd](#cpaintdc__m_hwnd).  \n  \n## See Also  \n [MFC Sample MDI](../../visual-cpp-samples.md)   \n [CDC Class](../../mfc/reference/cdc-class.md)   \n [Hierarchy Chart](../../mfc/hierarchy-chart.md)\n\n\n\n"}
