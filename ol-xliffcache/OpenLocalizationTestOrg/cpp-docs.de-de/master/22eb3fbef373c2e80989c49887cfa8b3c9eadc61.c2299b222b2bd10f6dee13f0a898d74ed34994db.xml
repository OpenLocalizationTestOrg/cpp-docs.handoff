You can also overload the `<<` operator for your own classes.  \n  \n## Example  \n The `write` function example showed the use of a `Date` structure. A date is an ideal candidate for a C++ class in which the data members (month, day, and year) are hidden from view. An output stream is the logical destination for displaying such a structure. This code displays a date using the `cout` object:  \n  \n```  \nDate dt(1, 2, 92);\n\ncout <<dt;  \n```  \n  \n To get `cout` to accept a `Date` object after the insertion operator, overload the insertion operator to recognize an `ostream` object on the left and a `Date` on the right. The overloaded `<<` operator function must then be declared as a friend of class `Date` so it can access the private data within a `Date` object.  \n  \n```  \n// overload_date.cpp  \n// compile with: /EHsc  \n#include <iostream>  \nusing namespace std;  \n  \nclass Date  \n{  \n    int mo, da, yr;  \npublic:  \n    Date(int m, int d, int y)  \n    {  \n        mo = m; da = d; yr = y;  \n    }  \n    friend ostream& operator<<(ostream& os, const Date& dt);  \n};  \n  \nostream& operator<<(ostream& os, const Date& dt)  \n{  \n    os << dt.mo << '/' << dt.da << '/' << dt.yr;  \n    return os;  \n}  \n  \nint main()  \n{  \n    Date dt(5, 6, 92);  \n    cout << dt;  \n}  \n```  \n  \n```Output  \n5/6/92  \n```  \n  \n## Remarks  \n The overloaded operator returns a reference to the original `ostream` object, which means you can combine insertions:  \n  \n```  \ncout <<\"The date is\" <<dt <<flush;  \n```  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Output Streams](../standard-library/output-streams.md)\n\n"}
