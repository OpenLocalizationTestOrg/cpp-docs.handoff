Only one directory path should be specified for the TMP environment variable.  \n  \n-   If the error message occurs for a library name, and you recently ported the .mak file from a previous Microsoft Visual C++ development system, the library may no longer be valid. Ensure that the library still exists in this circumstance.  \n  \n-   Another program may have the file open and the linker cannot write to it.  \n  \n-   Incorrect LIB environment variable. For information on how to update the LIB environment variable, see [VC++ Directories Property Page](../../ide/vcpp-directories-property-page.md) . Make sure any directories with libraries you need are listed here.  \n  \n The linker uses temporary files in several cases. Even if you have sufficient disk space, a very large link can deplete or fragment the available disk space. Consider using this option:  \n  \n-   Use [/OPT (Optimizations)](../../build/reference/opt-optimizations.md); doing transitive comdat elimination reads all the object files multiple times."}
