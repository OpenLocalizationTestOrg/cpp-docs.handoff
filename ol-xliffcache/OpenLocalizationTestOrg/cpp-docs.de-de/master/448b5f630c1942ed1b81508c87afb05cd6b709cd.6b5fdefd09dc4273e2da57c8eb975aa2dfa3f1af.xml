Windows then searches for the DLLs in the following sequence:  \n  \n1.  The directory where the executable module for the current process is located.  \n  \n2.  The current directory.  \n  \n3.  The Windows system directory. The **GetSystemDirectory** function retrieves the path of this directory.  \n  \n4.  The Windows directory. The **GetWindowsDirectory** function retrieves the path of this directory.  \n  \n5.  The directories listed in the PATH environment variable.  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  The LIBPATH environment variable is not used.  \n  \n## What do you want to do?  \n  \n-   [Link implicitly](../build/linking-implicitly.md)  \n  \n-   [Link explicitly](../build/linking-explicitly.md)  \n  \n-   [Determine which linking method to use](../build/determining-which-linking-method-to-use.md)  \n  \n## See Also  \n [DLLs in Visual C++](../build/dlls-in-visual-cpp.md)"}
