If there is a better match at namespace scope, the current compiler will correctly call it, whereas previous compilers wouldn't consider it.  \n  \n This warning should be disabled after you successfully port your code to the current version.  The compiler may give false positives, generating this warning for code where there is no behavior change.  \n  \n This warning is off by default.
