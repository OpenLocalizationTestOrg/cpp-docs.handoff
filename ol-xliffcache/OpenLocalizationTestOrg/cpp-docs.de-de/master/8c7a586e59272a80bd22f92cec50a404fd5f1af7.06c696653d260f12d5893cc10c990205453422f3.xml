the compiler may call the function (and not replace the function call with an intrinsic) if it will result in better performance.  \n  \n **x86 Specific**  \n  \n The intrinsic floating-point functions do not perform any special checks on input values and so work in restricted ranges of input, and have different exception handling and boundary conditions than the library routines with the same name. Using the true intrinsic forms implies loss of IEEE exception handling, and loss of `_matherr` and `errno` functionality; the latter implies loss of ANSI conformance. However, the intrinsic forms can considerably speed up floating-point-intensive programs, and for many programs, the conformance issues are of little practical value.  \n  \n You can use the [Za](../../build/reference/za-ze-disable-language-extensions.md) compiler option to override generation of true intrinsic floating-point options. In this case, the functions are generated as library routines that pass arguments directly to the floating-point chip instead of pushing them onto the program stack.  \n  \n **END x86 Specific**  \n  \n You also use [intrinsic](../../preprocessor/intrinsic.md) to create intrinsic functions, or [function (C/C++)](../../preprocessor/function-c-cpp.md) to explicitly force a function call.  \n  \n### To set this compiler option in the Visual Studio development environment  \n  \n1.
