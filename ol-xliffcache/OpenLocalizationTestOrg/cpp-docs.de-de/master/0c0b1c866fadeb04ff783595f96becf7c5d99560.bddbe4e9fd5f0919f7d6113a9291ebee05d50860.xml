basic_string Class\nThe sequences controlled by an object of template class `basic_string` are the Standard C++ string class and are usually referred to as strings, but they should not be confused with the null-terminated C-style strings used throughout the Standard C++ Library. The Standard C++ string is a container that enables the use of strings as normal types, such as comparison and concatenation operations, iterators, STL algorithms, and copying and assigning with class allocator managed memory. If you need to convert a Standard C++ string to a null-terminated C-style string, use the [basic_string::c_str](#basic_string__c_str) member.  \n  \n## Syntax  \n  \n```  \ntemplate <class CharType, class Traits = char_traits<CharType>, class Allocator = allocator<CharType>>  \nclass basic_string;  \n```  \n  \n#### Parameters  \n `CharType`  \n The data type of a single character to be stored in the string. The Standard C++ Library provides specializations of this template class, with the type definitions [string](../standard-library/string-typedefs.md#string) for elements of type `char`, [wstring](../standard-library/string-typedefs.md#wstring), for `wchar_t`, [u16string](../standard-library/string-typedefs.md#u16string) for `char16_t`, and [u32string](../standard-library/string-typedefs.md#u32string) for `char32_t`.  \n  \n `Traits`  \n Various important properties of the **CharType** elements in a basic_string specialization are described by the class **Traits**. The default value is `char_traits`< `CharType`>.  \n  \n `Allocator`  \n The type that represents the stored allocator object that encapsulates details about the string's allocation and deallocation of memory.

An invalid index, which is an index less that zero or greater than or equal to the size of the string, passed to the member function **at** throws an [out_of_range Class](../standard-library/out-of-range-class.md) exception. An invalid index passed to the `operator[]` results in undefined behavior, but the index equal to the length of the string is a valid index for const strings and the operator returns the null-character when passed this index.  \n  \n The reference returned may be invalidated by string reallocations or modifications for the non- **const** strings.  \n  \n### Example  \n  \n```cpp  \n// basic_string_at.cpp  \n// compile with: /EHsc  \n#include <string>  \n#include <iostream>  \n  \nint main( )  \n{  \n   using namespace std;  \n   string str1 ( \"Hello world\" ), str2 ( \"Goodbye world\" );  \n   const string  cstr1 ( \"Hello there\" ), cstr2 ( \"Goodbye now\" );  \n   cout << \"The original string str1 is: \" << str1 << endl;  \n   cout << \"The original string str2 is: \" << str2 << endl;  \n  \n   // Element access to the non const strings  \n   basic_string <char>::reference refStr1 = str1 [6];  \n   basic_string <char>::reference refStr2 = str2.at ( 3 );  \n  \n   cout << \"The character with an index of 6 in string str1 is: \"  \n        << refStr1 << \".\" << endl;  \n   cout << \"The character with an index of 3 in string str2 is: \"  \n        << refStr2 << \".\" << endl;  \n  \n   // Element access to the const strings  \n   basic_string <char>::const_reference crefStr1 = cstr1 [ cstr1.length ( ) ];  \n   basic_string <char>::const_reference crefStr2 = cstr2.at ( 8 );  \n  \n   if ( crefStr1 == '\\0' )  \n      cout << \"The null character is returned as a valid reference.\"  \n           << endl;  \n   else  \n      cout << \"The null character is not returned.\" << endl;  \n   cout << \"The character with index 8 in the const string cstr2 is: \"  \n        << crefStr2 << \".\" << endl;  \n}  \n```  \n  \n##  <a name=\"basic_string__back\"></a>  basic_string::back  \n Returns a reference to the last element in the string.  \n  \n```  \nconst_reference back() const;\n\n \nreference back();\n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n A reference to the last element of the string, which must be non-empty.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n  \n##  <a name=\"basic_string__basic_string\"></a>  basic_string::basic_string  \n Constructs a string that is empty, initialized by specific characters, or is a copy of all or part of another string object or C style (null-terminated) string.  \n  \n```  \nbasic_string();\n\nexplicit basic_string(\n    const allocator_type& _Al);\n\nbasic_string(\n    const basic_string& right);\n\nbasic_string(\n    basic_string&& right);\n\nbasic_string(\n    const basic_string& right,   \n    size_type _Roff,  \n    size_type count = npos);\n\nbasic_string(\n    const basic_string& right,   \n    size_type _Roff,  \n    size_type count,   \n    const allocator_type& _Al);\n\nbasic_string(\n    const value_type* ptr,   \n    size_type count);\n\nbasic_string(\n    const value_type* ptr,   \n    size_type count,  \n    const allocator_type& _Al);\n\nbasic_string(\n    const value_type* ptr);\n\nbasic_string(\n    const value_type* ptr,  \n    const allocator_type& _Al);\n\nbasic_string(\n    size_type count,   \n    value_type _Ch);\n\nbasic_string(\n    size_type count,   \n    value_type _Ch,  \n    const allocator_type& _Al);\n\ntemplate <class InputIterator>  \nbasic_string(\n InputIterator first,   \n    InputIterator last);\n\ntemplate <class InputIterator>  \nbasic_string(\n InputIterator first,   \n    InputIterator last,   \n    const allocator_type& _Al);\n\nbasic_string(\n    const_pointer first,  \n    const_pointer last);\n\nbasic_string(\n    const_iterator first,  \n    const_iterator last);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n ` ptr`  \n The C-string whose characters are to be used to initialize the `string` being constructed. This value cannot be a null pointer.  \n  \n `_Al`  \n The storage allocator class for the string object being constructed.  \n  \n ` count`  \n The number of characters to be initialized.  \n  \n ` right`  \n The string to initialize the string being constructed.  \n  \n `_Roff`  \n The index of a character in a string that is the first to be used to initialize character values for the string being constructed.  \n  \n `_Ch`  \n The character value to be copied into the string being constructed.  \n  \n ` first`  \n An input iterator, const_pointer, or const_iterator addressing the first element in the source range to be inserted.  \n  \n ` last`  \n An input iterator, const_pointer, or const_iterator addressing the position of the one beyond the last element in the source range to be inserted.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n A reference to the string object that is being constructed by the constructors.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n All constructors store an [basic_string::allocator_type](#basic_string__allocator_type) and initialize the controlled sequence. The allocator object is the argument `al`, if present. For the copy constructor, it is `right.`[basic_string::get_allocator](#basic_string__get_allocator)`()`. Otherwise, it is `Alloc()`.  \n  \n The controlled sequence is initialized to a copy of the operand sequence specified by the remaining operands. A constructor without an operand sequence specifies an empty initial controlled sequence. If `InputIterator` is an integer type in a template constructor, the operand sequence _F `irst,  last` behaves the same as `(size_type) first, (value_type) last`.  \n  \n### Example  \n  \n```cpp  \n// basic_string_ctor.cpp  \n// compile with: /EHsc  \n#include <string>  \n#include <iostream>  \n  \nint main( )  \n{  \n   using namespace std;  \n  \n   // The first member function initializing with a C-string  \n   const char *cstr1a = \"Hello Out There.\";  \n   basic_string <char> str1a ( cstr1a , 5);  \n   cout << \"The string initialized by C-string cstr1a is: \"  \n        << str1a << \".\" << endl;  \n  \n   // The second member function initializing with a string  \n   string  str2a ( \"How Do You Do\" );  \n   basic_string <char> str2b ( str2a , 7 , 7 );  \n   cout << \"The string initialized by part of the string cstr2a is: \"  \n        << str2b << \".\" << endl;  \n  \n   // The third member function initializing a string  \n   // with a number of characters of a specific value  \n   basic_string <char> str3a ( 5, '9' );  \n   cout << \"The string initialized by five number 9s is: \"  \n        << str3a << endl;  \n  \n   // The fourth member function creates an empty string  \n   // and string with a specified allocator  \n   basic_string <char> str4a;  \n   string str4b;  \n   basic_string <char> str4c ( str4b.get_allocator( ) );  \n   if (str4c.empty ( ) )  \n      cout << \"The string str4c is empty.\" << endl;  \n   else  \n      cout << \"The string str4c is not empty.\" << endl;  \n  \n   // The fifth member function initializes a string from  \n   // another range of characters  \n   string str5a ( \"Hello World\" );  \n   basic_string <char> str5b ( str5a.begin ( ) + 5 , str5a.end ( ) );  \n   cout << \"The string initialized by another range is: \"  \n        << str5b << \".\" << endl;  \n}  \n```  \n  \n##  <a name=\"basic_string__begin\"></a>  basic_string::begin  \n Returns an iterator addressing the first element in the string.  \n  \n```  \nconst_iterator begin() const;\n\n \niterator begin();\n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n A random-access iterator that addresses the first element of the sequence or just beyond the end of an empty sequence.  \n  \n### Example  \n  \n```cpp  \n// basic_string_begin.cpp  \n// compile with: /EHsc  \n#include <string>  \n#include <iostream>  \n  \nint main( ) {  \n   using namespace std;  \n   string str1 ( \"No way out.\" ), str2;  \n   basic_string <char>::iterator strp_Iter, str1_Iter, str2_Iter;  \n   basic_string <char>::const_iterator str1_cIter;  \n  \n   str1_Iter = str1.begin ( );  \n   cout << \"The first character of the string str1 is: \"   \n        << *str1_Iter << endl;  \n   cout << \"The full original string str1 is: \" << str1 << endl;  \n  \n   // The dereferenced iterator can be used to modify a character  \n *str1_Iter = 'G';  \n   cout << \"The first character of the modified str1 is now: \"   \n        << *str1_Iter << endl;  \n   cout << \"The full modified string str1 is now: \" << str1 << endl;  \n  \n   // The following line would be an error because iterator is const  \n   // *str1_cIter = 'g';  \n  \n   // For an empty string, begin is equivalent to end  \n   if (  str2.begin ( ) == str2.end ( ) )  \n      cout << \"The string str2 is empty.\" << endl;  \n   else  \n      cout << \"The string str2 is not empty.\" << endl;  \n}  \n```  \n  \n##  <a name=\"basic_string__c_str\"></a>  basic_string::c_str  \n Converts the contents of a string as a C-style, null-terminated string.  \n  \n```  \nconst value_type *c_str() const;\n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n A pointer to the C-style version of the invoking string.  The pointer value is not valid after calling a non-const function, including the destructor, in the basic_string class on the object.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n Objects of type string belonging to the C++ template class basic_string\\<char> are not necessarily null terminated. The null character ' \\0 ' is used as a special character in a C-string to mark the end of the string but has no special meaning in an object of type string and may be a part of the string just like any other character. There is an automatic conversion from const **char\\*** into strings, but the string class does not provide for automatic conversions from C-style strings to objects of type **basic_string\\<char>**.  \n  \n The returned C-style string should not be modified, as this could invalidate the pointer to the string, or deleted, as the string has a limited lifetime and is owned by the class string.  \n  \n### Example  \n  \n```cpp  \n// basic_string_c_str.cpp  \n// compile with: /EHsc  \n#include <string>  \n#include <iostream>  \n  \nint main( )   \n{  \n   using namespace std;  \n  \n   string  str1 ( \"Hello world\" );  \n   cout << \"The original string object str1 is: \"   \n        << str1 << endl;  \n   cout << \"The length of the string object str1 = \"   \n        << str1.length ( ) << endl << endl;  \n  \n   // Converting a string to an array of characters  \n   const char *ptr1 = 0;  \n   ptr1= str1.data ( );  \n   cout << \"The modified string object ptr1 is: \" << ptr1   \n        << endl;  \n   cout << \"The length of character array str1 = \"   \n        << strlen ( ptr1) << endl << endl;  \n  \n   // Converting a string to a C-style string  \n   const char *c_str1 = str1.c_str ( );  \n   cout << \"The C-style string c_str1 is: \" << c_str1   \n        << endl;  \n   cout << \"The length of C-style string str1 = \"   \n        << strlen ( c_str1) << endl << endl;  \n}  \n```  \n  \n```Output  \nThe original string object str1 is: Hello world  \nThe length of the string object str1 = 11  \n  \nThe modified string object ptr1 is: Hello world  \nThe length of character array str1 = 11  \n  \nThe C-style string c_str1 is: Hello world  \nThe length of C-style string str1 = 11  \n```  \n  \n##  <a name=\"basic_string__capacity\"></a>  basic_string::capacity  \n Returns the largest number of elements that could be stored in a string without increasing the memory allocation of the string.  \n  \n```  \nsize_type capacity() const;\n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n The size of storage currently allocated in memory to hold the string.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The member function returns the storage currently allocated to hold the controlled sequence, a value at least as large as [size](#basic_string__size).  \n  \n### Example  \n  \n```cpp  \n// basic_string_capacity.cpp  \n// compile with: /EHsc  \n#include <string>  \n#include <iostream>  \n  \nint main( )   \n{  \n   using namespace std;  \n   string  str1 (\"Hello world\");  \n   cout << \"The original string str1 is: \" << str1 << endl;  \n  \n   // The size and length member functions differ in name only  \n   basic_string <char>::size_type sizeStr1, lenStr1;  \n   sizeStr1 = str1.size ( );  \n   lenStr1 = str1.length ( );  \n  \n   basic_string <char>::size_type capStr1, max_sizeStr1;  \n   capStr1 = str1.capacity ( );  \n   max_sizeStr1 = str1.max_size ( );  \n  \n   // Compare size, length, capacity & max_size of a string  \n   cout << \"The current size of original string str1 is: \"   \n        << sizeStr1 << \".\" << endl;  \n   cout << \"The current length of original string str1 is: \"   \n        << lenStr1 << \".\" << endl;  \n   cout << \"The capacity of original string str1 is: \"  \n        << capStr1 << \".\" << endl;  \n   cout << \"The max_size of original string str1 is: \"   \n        << max_sizeStr1 << \".\" << endl << endl;  \n  \n   str1.erase ( 6, 5 );  \n   cout << \"The modified string str1 is: \" << str1 << endl;  \n  \n   sizeStr1 = str1.size (  );  \n   lenStr1 = str1.length (  );  \n   capStr1 = str1.capacity (  );  \n   max_sizeStr1 = str1.max_size (  );  \n  \n   // Compare size, length, capacity & max_size of a string  \n   // after erasing part of the original string  \n   cout << \"The current size of modified string str1 is: \"   \n        << sizeStr1 << \".\" << endl;  \n   cout << \"The current length of modified string str1 is: \"   \n        << lenStr1 << \".\" << endl;  \n   cout << \"The capacity of modified string str1 is: \"  \n        << capStr1 << \".\" << endl;  \n   cout << \"The max_size of modified string str1 is: \"   \n        << max_sizeStr1 << \".\" << endl;  \n}  \n```  \n  \n##  <a name=\"basic_string__cbegin\"></a>  basic_string::cbegin  \n Returns a `const` iterator that addresses the first element in the range.  \n  \n```  \nconst_iterator cbegin() const;\n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n A `const` random-access iterator that points at the first element of the range, or the location just beyond the end of an empty range (for an empty range, `cbegin() == cend()`).  \n  \n### Remarks  \n With the return value of `cbegin`, the elements in the range cannot be modified.  \n  \n You can use this member function in place of the `begin()` member function to guarantee that the return value is `const_iterator`.

An invalid index (an index less that zero or greater than or equal to the size of the string) passed to the member function **at** throws an [out_of_range Class](../standard-library/out-of-range-class.md) exception. An invalid index passed to `operator[]` results in undefined behavior, but the index equal to the length of the string is a valid index for const strings and the operator returns the null character when passed this index.  \n  \n The reference returned may be invalidated by string reallocations or modifications for the non- **const** strings.  \n  \n When compiling with _SECURE_SCL 1, a runtime error will occur if you attempt to access an element outside the bounds of the string.

Unlike vector, the member function **reserve** may be called to shrink the capacity of an object. The request is nonbinding and may or may not happen. As the default value for the parameter is zero, a call of **reserve** is a non-binding request to shrink the capacity of the string to fit the number of characters currently in the string. The capacity is never reduced below the current number of characters.  \n  \n Calling `reserve` is the only possible way to shrink the capacity of a string. However, as noted above, this request is nonbinding and may not happen.  \n  \n### Example  \n  \n```cpp  \n// basic_string_reserve.cpp  \n// compile with: /EHsc  \n#include <string>  \n#include <iostream>  \n  \nint main( )   \n{  \n   using namespace std;
