For more information, see [STL Containers](../standard-library/stl-containers.md).  \n  \n Erases an element.  \n  \n## Syntax  \n  \n```  \n \n    iterator erase(\n    iterator _Where);\n\niterator erase(\n    iterator first,  \n    iterator last);\n```  \n  \n## Remarks  \n The first member function removes the element of the controlled sequence pointed to by _*Where***.** The second member function removes the elements of the controlled sequence in the range [` first`, ` last`). Both return an iterator that designates the first element remaining beyond any elements removed, or [end](../standard-library/container-class-end.md) if no such element exists.  \n  \n The member functions throw an exception only if a copy operation throws an exception.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Sample Container Class](../standard-library/sample-container-class.md)\n"}
