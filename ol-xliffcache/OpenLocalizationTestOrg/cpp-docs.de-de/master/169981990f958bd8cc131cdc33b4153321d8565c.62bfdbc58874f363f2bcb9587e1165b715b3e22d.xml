The following procedure describes how to create a common control dynamically and then work with it.  \n  \n### To use a common control as a child window  \n  \n1.  Define the control in the related class or handler.  \n  \n2.  Use the control's override of the [CWnd::Create](../mfc/reference/cwnd-class.md#cwnd__create) method to create the Windows control.  \n  \n3.  After the control has been created (as early as the `OnCreate` handler if you subclass the control), you can manipulate the control using its member functions. See the descriptions of individual controls at [Controls](../mfc/controls-mfc.md) for details on methods.  \n  \n4.  When you are finished with the control, use [CWnd::DestroyWindow](../mfc/reference/cwnd-class.md#cwnd__destroywindow) to destroy the control.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Making and Using Controls](../mfc/making-and-using-controls.md)   \n [Controls](../mfc/controls-mfc.md)\n\n"}
