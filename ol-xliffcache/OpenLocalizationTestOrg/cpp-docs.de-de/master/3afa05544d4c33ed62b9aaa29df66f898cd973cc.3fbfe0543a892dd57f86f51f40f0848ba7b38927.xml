MASM contains a macro language that has features such as looping, arithmetic, and text string processing. MASM also gives you greater control over the hardware because it supports the instruction sets of the 386, 486, and Pentium processors. By using MASM, you also can reduce time and memory overhead.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [ML and ML64 Command-Line Option](../../assembler/masm/ml-and-ml64-command-line-reference.md)  \n Describes the ML.exe and ML64.exe command-line options.  \n  \n [ML Error Messages](../../assembler/masm/ml-error-messages.md)  \n Describes ML.exe fatal and nonfatal error messages and warnings.  \n  \n [Directives Reference](../../assembler/masm/directives-reference.md)  \n Provides links to articles that discuss the use of directives in MASM.  \n  \n [Symbols Reference](../../assembler/masm/symbols-reference.md)  \n Provides links to articles that discuss the use of symbols in MASM.  \n  \n [Operators Reference](../../assembler/masm/operators-reference.md)  \n Provides links to articles that discuss the use of operators in MASM.  \n  \n [Processor Manufacturer Programming Manuals](../../assembler/masm/processor-manufacturer-programming-manuals.md)  \n Provides links to websites that may contain programming information about processors that are not manufactured, sold, or supported by Microsoft.  \n  \n [MASM for x64 (ml64.exe)](../../assembler/masm/masm-for-x64-ml64-exe.md)  \n Information about how to create output files for [!INCLUDE[vcprx64](../../assembler/inline/includes/vcprx64_md.md)].  \n  \n## Related Sections  \n [Visual C++](../../top/visual-cpp-in-visual-studio.md)  \n Provides links to different areas of the Visual Studio and Visual C++ documentation.  \n  \n [Visual C++ Reference](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/1ba03b5c-8229-4f63-b08c-6c12141d6ab1)  \n Provides links to articles that describe the C and C++ language references, the libraries that are included with Visual C++, and the Visual C++ Extensibility Object Model.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Compiler Intrinsics](../../intrinsics/compiler-intrinsics.md)   \n [x86Intrinsics](../../intrinsics/x86-intrinsics-list.md)   \n [x64 (amd64) Intrinsics](../../intrinsics/x64-amd64-intrinsics-list.md)"}
