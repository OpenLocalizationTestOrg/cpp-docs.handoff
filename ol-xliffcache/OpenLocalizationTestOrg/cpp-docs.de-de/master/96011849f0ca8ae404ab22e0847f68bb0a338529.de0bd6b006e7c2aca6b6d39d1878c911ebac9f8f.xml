This class should only be used by developers implementing custom string managers. For more information on custom string managers, see [Memory Management and CStringT](../../atl-mfc-shared/memory-management-with-cstringt.md)  \n  \n This class encapsulates various types of information and data associated with a higher string object, such as [CStringT](../../atl-mfc-shared/reference/cstringt-class.md), [CSimpleStringT](../../atl-mfc-shared/reference/csimplestringt-class.md), or [CFixedStringT](../../atl-mfc-shared/reference/cfixedstringt-class.md) objects. Every higher string object contains a pointer to its associated `CStringData` object, allowing multiple string objects to point to the same string data object. This relationship is represented by the reference count ( `nRefs`) of the `CStringData` object.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  In certain cases, a string type (such as **CFixedString**) will not share a string data object with more than one higher string object. For more information on this, see [Memory Management and CStringT](../../atl-mfc-shared/memory-management-with-cstringt.md).  \n  \n This data is composed of:  \n  \n-   The memory manager (of type [IAtlStringMgr](../../atl-mfc-shared/reference/iatlstringmgr-class.md)) of the string.  \n  \n-   The current length ( [nDataLength](#cstringdata__ndatalength)) of the string.  \n  \n-   The allocated length ( [nAllocLength](#cstringdata__nalloclength)) of the string. For performance reasons, this can differ from the current string length  \n  \n-   The current reference count ( [nRefs](#cstringdata__nrefs)) of the `CStringData` object. This value is used in determining how many string objects are sharing the same `CStringData` object.  \n  \n-   The actual character buffer ( [data](#cstringdata__data)) of the string.  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  The actual character buffer of the string object is allocated by the string manager and is appended to the `CStringData` object.  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Header:** atlsimpstr.h  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cstringdata__addref\"></a>  CStringData::AddRef  \n Increments the reference count of the string object.  \n  \n```\nvoid AddRef() throw();\n```  \n  \n### Remarks  \n Increments the reference count of the string object.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  Do not call this method on a string with a negative reference count, since a negative count indicates that the string buffer is locked.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cstringdata__data\"></a>  CStringData::data  \n Returns a pointer to the character buffer of a string object.  \n  \n```\nvoid* data() throw();\n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n A pointer to the character buffer of the string object.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n Call this function to return the current character buffer of the associated string object.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  This buffer is not allocated by the `CStringData` object but by the string manager when needed.

Locking and unlocking is used when direct access to the character buffer is required by the developer. A good example of locking is demonstrated by the [LockBuffer](../../atl-mfc-shared/reference/csimplestringt-class.md#csimplestringt__lockbuffer) and [UnlockBuffer](../../atl-mfc-shared/reference/csimplestringt-class.md#csimplestringt__unlockbuffer) methods of `CSimpleStringT`.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  A character buffer can only be locked if the buffer is not shared among higher string objects.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cstringdata__nalloclength\"></a>  CStringData::nAllocLength  \n Length of the allocated character buffer.  \n  \n```\nint nAllocLength;\n```  \n  \n### Remarks  \n Stores the length of the allocated data buffer in `XCHAR`s (not including terminating null).  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cstringdata__ndatalength\"></a>  CStringData::nDataLength  \n Current length of the string object.  \n  \n```\nint nDataLength;\n```  \n  \n### Remarks  \n Stores the length of currently used data in `XCHAR`s (not including terminating null).  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cstringdata__nrefs\"></a>  CStringData::nRefs  \n Reference count of the string data object.  \n  \n```\nlong nRefs;\n```  \n  \n### Remarks  \n Stores the reference count of the string data object. This count indicates the number of higher string objects that are associated with the string data object. A negative value indicates that the string data object is currently locked.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cstringdata__pstringmgr\"></a>  CStringData::pStringMgr  \n The memory manager of the associated string object.  \n  \n```\nIAtlStringMgr* pStringMgr;\n```  \n  \n### Remarks  \n Stores the memory manager for the associated string object.

This is commonly done when a string object is deleted, and therefore no longer needs to reference the string data object.  \n  \n For example, the following code would call `CStringData::Release` for the string data object associated with `str1`:  \n  \n [!code-cpp[NVC_ATLMFC_Utilities#104](../../atl-mfc-shared/codesnippet/cpp/cstringdata-class_1.cpp)]  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cstringdata__unlock\"></a>  CStringData::Unlock  \n Unlocks the character buffer of the associated string object.  \n  \n```\nvoid Unlock() throw();\n```  \n  \n### Remarks  \n Call this function to unlock the character buffer of the string data object. Once a buffer is unlocked, it is shareable and can be reference counted.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  Each call to `Lock` must be matched by a corresponding call to `Unlock`.  \n  \n Locking and unlocking is used when the developer must ensure that the string data not be shared. A good example of locking is demonstrated by the [LockBuffer](../../atl-mfc-shared/reference/csimplestringt-class.md#csimplestringt__lockbuffer) and [UnlockBuffer](../../atl-mfc-shared/reference/csimplestringt-class.md#csimplestringt__unlockbuffer) methods of `CSimpleStringT`.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Hierarchy Chart](../../mfc/hierarchy-chart.md)   \n [ATL/MFC Shared Classes](../../atl-mfc-shared/atl-mfc-shared-classes.md)\n\n\n"}
