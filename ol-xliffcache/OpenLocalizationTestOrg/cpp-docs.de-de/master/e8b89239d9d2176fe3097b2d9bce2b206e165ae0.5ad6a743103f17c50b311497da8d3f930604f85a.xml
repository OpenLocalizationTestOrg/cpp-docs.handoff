_lseeki64\nMoves a file pointer to the specified location.  \n  \n## Syntax  \n  \n```  \n  \n      long _lseek(  \n   int fd,  \n   long offset,  \n   int origin   \n);  \n__int64 _lseeki64(  \n   int fd,  \n   __int64 offset,  \n   int origin   \n);  \n```  \n  \n#### Parameters  \n `fd`  \n File descriptor referring to an open file.  \n  \n *offset*  \n Number of bytes from *origin*.  \n  \n *origin*  \n Initial position.  \n  \n## Return Value  \n `_lseek` returns the offset, in bytes, of the new position from the beginning of the file. `_lseeki64` returns the offset in a 64-bit integer. The function returns –1L to indicate an error. If passed an invalid parameter, such as a bad file descriptor, or the value for *origin* is invalid or the position specified by *offset* is before the beginning of the file, the invalid parameter handler is invoked, as described in [Parameter Validation](../../c-runtime-library/parameter-validation.md). If execution is allowed to continue, these functions set `errno` to `EBADF` and return -1L. On devices incapable of seeking (such as terminals and printers), the return value is undefined.  \n  \n For more information about these and other error codes, see [_doserrno, errno, _sys_errlist, and _sys_nerr](../../c-runtime-library/errno-doserrno-sys-errlist-and-sys-nerr.md).  \n  \n## Remarks  \n The `_lseek` function moves the file pointer associated with `fd` to a new location that is *offset* bytes from *origin*. The next operation on the file occurs at the new location. The *origin* argument must be one of the following constants, which are defined in Stdio.h.  \n  \n `SEEK_SET`  \n Beginning of the file.  \n  \n `SEEK_CUR`  \n Current position of the file pointer.  \n  \n `SEEK_END`  \n End of file.  \n  \n You can use `_lseek` to reposition the pointer anywhere in a file or beyond the end of the file.  \n  \n## Requirements  \n  \n|Routine|Required header|  \n|-------------|---------------------|  \n|`_lseek`|\\<io.h>|  \n|`_lseeki64`|\\<io.h>|  \n  \n For more compatibility information, see [Compatibility](../../c-runtime-library/compatibility.md) in the Introduction.  \n  \n## Libraries  \n All versions of the [C run-time libraries](../../c-runtime-library/crt-library-features.md).  \n  \n## Example  \n  \n```  \n// crt_lseek.c  \n/* This program first opens a file named lseek.txt.  \n * It then uses _lseek to find the beginning of the file,  \n * to find the current position in the file, and to find  \n * the end of the file.  \n */  \n  \n#include <io.h>  \n#include <fcntl.h>  \n#include <stdlib.h>  \n#include <stdio.h>  \n#include <share.h>  \n  \nint main( void )  \n{  \n   int fh;  \n   long pos;               /* Position of file pointer */  \n   char buffer[10];  \n  \n   _sopen_s( &fh, \"crt_lseek.c_input\", _O_RDONLY, _SH_DENYNO, 0 );  \n  \n   /* Seek the beginning of the file: */  \n   pos = _lseek( fh, 0L, SEEK_SET );  \n   if( pos == -1L )  \n      perror( \"_lseek to beginning failed\" );  \n   else  \n      printf( \"Position for beginning of file seek = %ld\\n\", pos );  \n  \n   /* Move file pointer a little */  \n    _read( fh, buffer, 10 );  \n  \n   /* Find current position: */  \n   pos = _lseek( fh, 0L, SEEK_CUR );  \n   if( pos == -1L )  \n      perror( \"_lseek to current position failed\" );  \n   else  \n      printf( \"Position for current position seek = %ld\\n\", pos );  \n  \n   /* Set the end of the file: */  \n   pos = _lseek( fh, 0L, SEEK_END );  \n   if( pos == -1L )  \n      perror( \"_lseek to end failed\" );  \n   else  \n      printf( \"Position for end of file seek = %ld\\n\", pos );  \n  \n   _close( fh );  \n}  \n```  \n  \n## Input: crt_lseek.c_input  \n  \n```  \nLine one.  \nLine two.  \nLine three.  \nLine four.  \nLine five.  \n```  \n  \n## Output  \n  \n```  \nPosition for beginning of file seek = 0  \nPosition for current position seek = 10  \nPosition for end of file seek = 57  \n```  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Low-Level I/O](../../c-runtime-library/low-level-i-o.md)   \n [fseek, _fseeki64](../../c-runtime-library/reference/fseek-fseeki64.md)   \n [_tell, _telli64](../../c-runtime-library/reference/tell-telli64.md)"}
