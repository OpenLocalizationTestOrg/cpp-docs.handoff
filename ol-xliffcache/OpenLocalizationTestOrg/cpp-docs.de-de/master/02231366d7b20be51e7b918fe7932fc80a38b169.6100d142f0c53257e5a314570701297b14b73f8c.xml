The value 65535 is not allowed for any part of the assembly version number. The valid range for assembly versions is 0 – 65534.  \n  \n LNK1256 can also be caused if ALINK could not find the named key container. Delete the key container and add it again to the strong name CSP by using [Sn.exe (Strong Name Tool)](http://msdn.microsoft.com/Library/c1d2b532-1b8e-4c7a-8ac5-53b801135ec6).  \n  \n Another reason for LNK1256 is a version mismatch between the linker and Alink.dll. This can be caused by a corrupted Visual Studio installation. Use **Programs and Features** in the Windows Control Panel to repair or reinstall Visual Studio.  \n  \n The following sample generates LNK1256:  \n  \n```  \n// LNK1256.cpp  \n// compile with: /clr /LD  \n// LNK1256 expected  \n[assembly:System::Reflection::AssemblyVersionAttribute(\"1.0.65535\")];  \npublic class CMyClass {  \npublic:  \n   int value;  \n};  \n```"}
