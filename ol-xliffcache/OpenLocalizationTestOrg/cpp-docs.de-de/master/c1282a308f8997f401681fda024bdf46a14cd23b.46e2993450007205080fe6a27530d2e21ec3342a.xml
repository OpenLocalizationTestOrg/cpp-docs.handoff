control's class factory. Because your control is an actual OLE object, the class factory is responsible for creating instances of your control. Every OLE control class must have a class factory.  \n  \n Another important feature of OLE controls is their ability to enforce a license. ControlWizard allows you to incorporate licensing during the creation of your control project. For more information on control licensing, see the article [ActiveX Controls: Licensing An ActiveX Control](../../mfc/mfc-activex-controls-licensing-an-activex-control.md).  \n  \n The following table lists several macros and functions used to declare and implement your control's class factory and to license of your control.  \n  \n### Class Factories and Licensing  \n  \n|||  \n|-|-|  \n|[DECLARE_OLECREATE_EX](#declare_olecreate_ex)|Declares the class factory for an OLE control or property page.|  \n|[IMPLEMENT_OLECREATE_EX](#implement_olecreate_ex)|Implements the control's `GetClassID` function and declares an instance of the class factory.|  \n|[BEGIN_OLEFACTORY](#begin_olefactory)|Begins the declaration of any licensing functions.|  \n|[END_OLEFACTORY](#end_olefactory)|Ends the declaration of any licensing functions.|  \n|[AfxVerifyLicFile](#afxverifylicfile)|Verifies whether a control is licensed for use on a particular computer.|  \n  \n##  <a name=\"declare_olecreate_ex\"></a>  DECLARE_OLECREATE_EX  \n Declares a class factory and the `GetClassID` member function of your control class.  \n  \n```   \nDECLARE_OLECREATE_EX(class_name)   \n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n *class_name*  \n The name of the control class.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n Use this macro in the control class header file for a control that does not support licensing.  \n  \n Note that this macro serves the same purpose as the following code sample:  \n  \n [!code-cpp[NVC_MFCAxCtl#14](../../mfc/reference/codesnippet/cpp/class-factories-and-licensing_1.h)]  \n  \n##  <a name=\"implement_olecreate_ex\"></a>  IMPLEMENT_OLECREATE_EX  \n Implements your control's class factory and the [GetClassID](../../mfc/reference/colecontrol-class.md#colecontrol__getclassid) member function of your control class.  \n  \n```   \nIMPLEMENT_OLECREATE_EX(\n   class_name,   \n    external_name,    \n    l,   \n    w1,   \n    w2,   \n    b1,   \n    b2,   \n    b3,   \n    b4,   \n    b5,   \n    b6,   \n    b7,\n    b8)   \n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n *class_name*  \n The name of the control property page class.  \n  \n *external_name*  \n The object name exposed to applications.  \n  \n *l, w1, w2, b1, b2, b3, b4, b5, b6, b7, b8*  \n Components of the class's **CLSID**. For more information on these parameters, see the Remarks for [IMPLEMENT_OLECREATE](run-time-object-model-services.md#implement_olecreate).  \n  \n### Remarks  \n This macro must appear in the implementation file for any control class that uses the `DECLARE_OLECREATE_EX` macro or the `BEGIN_OLEFACTORY` and `END_OLEFACTORY` macros. The external name is the identifier of the OLE control that is exposed to other applications. Containers use this name to request an object of this control class.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"begin_olefactory\"></a>  BEGIN_OLEFACTORY  \n Begins the declaration of your class factory in the header file of your control class.  \n  \n``` \nBEGIN_OLEFACTORY(class_name)  \n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n *class_name*  \n Specifies the name of the control class whose class factory this is.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n Declarations of class factory licensing functions should begin immediately after `BEGIN_OLEFACTORY`.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"end_olefactory\"></a>  END_OLEFACTORY  \n Ends the declaration of your control's class factory.  \n  \n```  \nEND_OLEFACTORY(class_name)   \n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n *class_name*  \n The name of the control class whose class factory this is.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"afxverifylicfile\"></a>  AfxVerifyLicFile  \n Call this function to verify that the license file named by `pszLicFileName` is valid for the OLE control.  \n  \n```   \nBOOL AFXAPI AfxVerifyLicFile(\n    HINSTANCE  hInstance,  \n    LPCTSTR  pszLicFileName,  \n    LPOLESTR  pszLicFileContents,  \n    UINT cch = -1); \n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `hInstance`  \n The instance handle of the DLL associated with the licensed control.  \n  \n `pszLicFileName`  \n Points to a null-terminated character string containing the license filename.  \n  \n `pszLicFileContents`  \n Points to a byte sequence that must match the sequence found at the beginning of the license file.  \n  \n `cch`  \n Number of characters in `pszLicFileContents`.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Nonzero if the license file exists and begins with the character sequence in `pszLicFileContents`; otherwise 0.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n If `cch` is â€“ 1, this function uses:  \n  \n [!code-cpp[NVC_MFC_Utilities#36](../../mfc/codesnippet/cpp/class-factories-and-licensing_2.cpp)]  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Macros and Globals](../../mfc/reference/mfc-macros-and-globals.md)\n"}
