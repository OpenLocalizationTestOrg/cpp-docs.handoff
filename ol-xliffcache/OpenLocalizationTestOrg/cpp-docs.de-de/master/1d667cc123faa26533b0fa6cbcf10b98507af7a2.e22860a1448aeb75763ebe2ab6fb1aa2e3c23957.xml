It also specifies the variable's storage class and data type.  \n  \n Storage classes or types (or both) are required on variable declarations. Untyped variables (such as `var;`) generate warnings.  \n  \n## Syntax  \n `declarator`:  \n *pointer* opt  \n  \n *direct-declarator*  \n  \n *direct-declarator*:  \n *identifier*  \n  \n *identifier*:  \n *nondigit*  \n  \n *identifier nondigit*  \n  \n *identifier digit*  \n  \n For arithmetic, structure, union, enumerations, and void types, and for types represented by `typedef` names, simple declarators can be used in a declaration since the type specifier supplies all the typing information. Pointer, array, and function types require more complicated declarators.  \n  \n You can use a list of identifiers separated by commas (**,**) to specify several variables in the same declaration. All variables defined in the declaration have the same base type. For example:  \n  \n```  \nint x, y;        /* Declares two simple variables of type int */  \nint const z = 1; /* Declares a constant value of type int */  \n```  \n  \n The variables `x` and `y` can hold any value in the set defined by the `int` type for a particular implementation. The simple object `z` is initialized to the value 1 and is not modifiable.  \n  \n If the declaration of `z` was for an uninitialized static variable or was at file scope, it would receive an initial value of 0, and that value would be unmodifiable.  \n  \n```  \nunsigned long reply, flag; /* Declares two variables  \n                              named reply and flag     */  \n```  \n  \n In this example, both the variables, `reply` and `flag`, have `unsigned long` type and hold unsigned integral values.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Declarators and Variable Declarations](../c-language/declarators-and-variable-declarations.md)"}
