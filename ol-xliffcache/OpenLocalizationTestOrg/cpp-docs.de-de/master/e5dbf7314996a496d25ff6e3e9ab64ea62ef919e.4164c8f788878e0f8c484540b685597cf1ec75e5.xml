You do this by assigning a text string to each menu command using the **Prompt** property in the Properties window. If you have a string in the [string table](../mfc/string-editor.md) whose ID is the same as the command, an MFC application will automatically display this string resource in the status bar of the running application when a user hovers over a menu item.  \n  \n### To associate a menu command with a status bar text string  \n  \n1.  In the **Menu** editor, select the menu command.  \n  \n2.  In the [Properties Window](/visualstudio/ide/reference/properties-window), type the associated status bar text in the **Prompt** box.  \n  \n For information on adding resources to managed projects, please see [Resources in Applications](http://msdn.microsoft.com/Library/8ad495d4-2941-40cf-bf64-e82e85825890) in the *.NET Framework Developer's Guide.* For information on manually adding resource files to managed projects, accessing resources, displaying static resources, and assigning resources strings to properties, see [Walkthrough: Using Resources for Localization with ASP.NET](http://msdn.microsoft.com/Library/bb4e5b44-e2b0-48ab-bbe9-609fb33900b6).  \n  \n **Requirements**  \n  \n MFC  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Strings (ATL/MFC)](../atl-mfc-shared/strings-atl-mfc.md)   \n [Adding Commands to a Menu](../windows/adding-commands-to-a-menu.md)   \n [Menu Editor](../mfc/menu-editor.md)"}
