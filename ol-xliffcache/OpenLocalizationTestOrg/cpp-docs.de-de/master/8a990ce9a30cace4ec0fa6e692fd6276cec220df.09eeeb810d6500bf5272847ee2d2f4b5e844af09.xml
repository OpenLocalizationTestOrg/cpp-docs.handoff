However, the framework routes commands to a number of candidate objects — called \"command targets\" — one of which normally invokes a handler for the command. The handler functions work the same way for both commands and standard Windows messages, but the mechanisms by which they are called are different, as explained in [How the Framework Calls a Handler](../mfc/how-the-framework-calls-a-handler.md).  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Messages and Commands in the Framework](../mfc/messages-and-commands-in-the-framework.md)\n\n"}
