By using [!INCLUDE[cppwrt](../build/reference/includes/cppwrt_md.md)] ([!INCLUDE[cppwrt_short](../build/reference/includes/cppwrt_short_md.md)]), you can program [!INCLUDE[win8_appname_long](../build/includes/win8_appname_long_md.md)] apps and components that compile to native code. Although you can create [!INCLUDE[win8_appname_long](../build/includes/win8_appname_long_md.md)] apps by programming directly against the [!INCLUDE[wrt](../atl/reference/includes/wrt_md.md)] COM interfaces, by using [!INCLUDE[cppwrt_short](../build/reference/includes/cppwrt_short_md.md)], you can work with constructors, exceptions, and other modern C++ programming idioms. To enable C++ programming in a managed execution environment on the .NET platform, you can use [!INCLUDE[cppcli](../build/reference/includes/cppcli_md.md)].  \n  \n **Two runtimes, one set of extensions**  \n  \n [!INCLUDE[cppwrt_short](../build/reference/includes/cppwrt_short_md.md)] is a subset of [!INCLUDE[cppcli](../build/reference/includes/cppcli_md.md)]. For extensions that are common to [!INCLUDE[cppwrt_short](../build/reference/includes/cppwrt_short_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[cppcli](../build/reference/includes/cppcli_md.md)], the semantics depend on whether you are targeting the common language runtime (CLR) or the [!INCLUDE[wrt](../atl/reference/includes/wrt_md.md)]. To compile your app to run on the [!INCLUDE[wrt](../atl/reference/includes/wrt_md.md)], specify the **/ZW** compiler option. To compile it to run on the CLR, specify the **/clr** compiler option. These switches are set automatically when you use Visual Studio to create a project.  \n  \n For more information about how to create [!INCLUDE[win8_appname_long](../build/includes/win8_appname_long_md.md)] apps in C++, see [Roadmap for Windows Runtime apps using C++](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh700360.aspx).  \n  \n [!INCLUDE[cppcli](../build/reference/includes/cppcli_md.md)] extends the ISO/ANSI C++ standard, and is defined under the Ecma [!INCLUDE[cppcli](../build/reference/includes/cppcli_md.md)] Standard. For more information, see [.NET Programming with C++/CLI (Visual C++)](../dotnet/dotnet-programming-with-cpp-cli-visual-cpp.md).  \n  \n## Data Type Keywords  \n The language extensions include *aggregate keywords*, which are keywords that consist of two tokens separated by white space. The tokens might have one meaning when they are used separately, and another meaning when they are used together. For example, the word \"ref\" is an ordinary identifier, and the word \"class\" is a keyword that declares a native class. But when these words are combined to form `ref class`, the resulting aggregate keyword declares an entity that is known as a *runtime class*.  \n  \n The extensions also include *context-sensitive* keywords. A keyword is treated as context-sensitive depending on the kind of statement that contains it, and its placement in that statement. For example, the token \"property\" can be an identifier, or it can declare a special kind of public class member.  \n  \n The following table lists keywords in the C++ language extension.  \n  \n|Keyword|Context sensitive|Purpose|Reference|  \n|-------------|-----------------------|-------------|---------------|  \n|`ref class`<br /><br /> `ref struct`|No|Declares a class.|[Classes and Structs](../windows/classes-and-structs-cpp-component-extensions.md)|  \n|`value class`<br /><br /> `value struct`|No|Declares a value class.|[Classes and Structs](../windows/classes-and-structs-cpp-component-extensions.md)|  \n|`interface class`<br /><br /> `interface struct`|No|Declares an interface.|[interface class](../windows/interface-class-cpp-component-extensions.md)|  \n|`enum class`<br /><br /> `enum struct`|No|Declares an enumeration.|[enum class](../windows/enum-class-cpp-component-extensions.md)|  \n|`property`|Yes|Declares a property.|[property](../windows/property-cpp-component-extensions.md)|  \n|`delegate`|Yes|Declares a delegate.|[delegate  (C++ Component Extensions)](../windows/delegate-cpp-component-extensions.md)|  \n|`event`|Yes|Declares an event.|[event](../windows/event-cpp-component-extensions.md)|  \n  \n## Override Specifiers  \n You can use the following keywords to qualify override behavior for derivation. Although the `new` keyword is not an extension of C++, it is listed here because it can be used in an additional context. Some specifiers are also valid for native programming. For more information, see [How to: Declare Override Specifiers in Native Compilations (C++/CLI)](../dotnet/how-to-declare-override-specifiers-in-native-compilations-cpp-cli.md).  \n  \n|Keyword|Context Sensitive|Purpose|Reference|  \n|-------------|-----------------------|-------------|---------------|  \n|`abstract`|Yes|Indicates that functions or classes are abstract.|[abstract](../windows/abstract-cpp-component-extensions.md)|  \n|`new`|No|Indicates that a function is not an override of a base class version.|[new (new slot in vtable)](../windows/new-new-slot-in-vtable-cpp-component-extensions.md)|  \n|`override`|Yes|Indicates that a method must be an override of a base-class version.|[override](../windows/override-cpp-component-extensions.md)|  \n|`sealed`|Yes|Prevents classes from being used as base classes.|[sealed](../windows/sealed-cpp-component-extensions.md)|  \n  \n## Keywords for Generics  \n The following keywords have been added to support generic types.

If you specify the **/ZW** compiler option, they are defined in the `lang` namespace. If you specify the **/clr** compiler option, they are defined in the `cli` namespace.  \n  \n|Keyword|Purpose|Reference|  \n|-------------|-------------|---------------|  \n|`array`|Declares an array.|[Arrays](../windows/arrays-cpp-component-extensions.md)|  \n|`interior_ptr`|(CLR only) Points to data in a reference type.|[interior_ptr (C++/CLI)](../windows/interior-ptr-cpp-cli.md)|  \n|`pin_ptr`|(CLR only) Points to CLR reference types to temporarily suppress the garbage-collection system.|[pin_ptr (C++/CLI)](../windows/pin-ptr-cpp-cli.md)|  \n|`safe_cast`|Determines and executes the optimal casting method for a runtime type.|[safe_cast](../windows/safe-cast-cpp-component-extensions.md)|  \n|`typeid`|(CLR only) Retrieves a <xref:System.Type?displayProperty=fullName> object that describes the given type or object.|[typeid](../windows/typeid-cpp-component-extensions.md)|  \n  \n## Declarators  \n The following type declarators instruct the runtime to automatically manage the lifetime and deletion of allocated objects.  \n  \n|Operator|Purpose|Reference|  \n|--------------|-------------|---------------|  \n|`^`|Declares a handle to an object; that is, a pointer to a [!INCLUDE[wrt](../atl/reference/includes/wrt_md.md)] or CLR object that is automatically deleted when it is no longer usable.|[Handle to Object Operator (^)](../windows/handle-to-object-operator-hat-cpp-component-extensions.md)|  \n|`%`|Declares a tracking reference; that is, a reference to a [!INCLUDE[wrt](../atl/reference/includes/wrt_md.md)] or CLR object that is automatically deleted when it is no longer usable.|[Tracking Reference Operator](../windows/tracking-reference-operator-cpp-component-extensions.md)|  \n  \n## Additional Constructs and Related Topics  \n This section lists additional programming constructs, and topics that pertain to the CLR.  \n  \n|Topic|Description|  \n|-----------|-----------------|  \n|[__identifier (C++/CLI)](../windows/identifier-cpp-cli.md)|([!INCLUDE[wrt](../atl/reference/includes/wrt_md.md)] and CLR) Enables the use of keywords as identifiers.|  \n|[Variable Argument Lists (...)
