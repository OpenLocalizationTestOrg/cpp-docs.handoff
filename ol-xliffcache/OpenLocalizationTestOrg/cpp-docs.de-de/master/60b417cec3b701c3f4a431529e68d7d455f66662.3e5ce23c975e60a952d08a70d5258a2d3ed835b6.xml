The [__vmx_vmlaunch](../intrinsics/vmx-vmlaunch.md) function can be used only with a VMCS whose launch state is `Clear`, and the [__vmx_vmresume](../intrinsics/vmx-vmresume.md) function can be used only with a VMCS whose launch state is `Launched`. Consequently, use the [__vmx_vmclear](../intrinsics/vmx-vmclear.md) function to set the launch state of a VMCS to `Clear`, and then use the [__vmx_vmlaunch](../intrinsics/vmx-vmlaunch.md) function for your first VM-enter operation and the [__vmx_vmresume](../intrinsics/vmx-vmresume.md) function for subsequent VM-enter operations.  \n  \n The `__vmx_vmlaunch` function is equivalent to the `VMLAUNCH` machine instruction. This function supports the interaction of a host's virtual machine monitor with a guest operating system and its applications.
