To do this, you open both files containing resources at the same time and drag items from one file to another or copy and paste between the two files. This method works for resource script (.rc) files and resource template (.rct) files, as well as executable (.exe) files.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  Visual C++ includes sample resource files that you can use in your own application. For more information, see [CLIPART: Common Resources](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/9bac2891-b6b3-49ec-a287-cec850c707e0).  \n  \n You can use the drag-and-drop method between .rc files that are open [outside of the project](../windows/how-to-open-a-resource-script-file-outside-of-a-project-standalone.md).  \n  \n### To copy resources between files using the drag-and-drop method  \n  \n1.  Open both resource files stand-alone (for more information, see [Viewing Resources in an .rc File Outside of a Project](../windows/how-to-open-a-resource-script-file-outside-of-a-project-standalone.md)). For example, open Source1.rc and Source2.rc.  \n  \n2.  Inside the first .rc file, click the resource you wish to copy. For example, in Source1.rc, click IDD_DIALOG1.  \n  \n3.  Hold down the CTRL key and drag the resource to the second .rc file. For example, drag IDD_DIALOG1 from Source1.rc to Source2.rc.  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  Dragging the resource without holding down the CTRL key moves the resource rather than copying it.  \n  \n### To copy resources using copy and paste  \n  \n1.  Open both resource files stand-alone (for more information, see [Viewing Resources in an .rc File Outside of a Project](../windows/how-to-open-a-resource-script-file-outside-of-a-project-standalone.md)). For example, Source1.rc and Source2.rc.  \n  \n2.  In the source file from which you wish to copy a resource (for example, Source1.rc), right-click a resource and choose **Copy** from the shortcut menu.  \n  \n3.  Right-click the resource file into which you'd like to paste the resource (for example, Source2.rc). Choose **Paste** from the shortcut menu.  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  You cannot drag and drop, copy, cut, or paste between resource files in the project (Resource View) and stand-alone .rc files (those open in document windows).
