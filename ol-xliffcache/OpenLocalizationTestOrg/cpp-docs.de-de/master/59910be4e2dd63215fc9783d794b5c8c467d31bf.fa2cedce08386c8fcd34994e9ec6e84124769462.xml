An AVI clip is a series of bitmap frames, like a movie.  \n  \n Since your thread continues executing while the AVI clip is displayed, one common use for an animation control is to indicate system activity during a lengthy operation. For example, the Windows Find dialog box displays a moving magnifying glass as the system searches for a file.  \n  \n Animation controls can only play simple AVI clips, and they do not support sound. (For a complete list of limitations, see [CAnimateCtrl](../mfc/reference/canimatectrl-class.md).) Since the capabilities of an animation control are severely limited and subject to change, you should use an alternative such as the MCIWnd control if you need a control to provide multimedia playback and/or recording capabilities. For more information about the MCIWnd control, see the multimedia documentation.  \n  \n## What do you want to know more about  \n  \n-   [Using an Animation Control](../mfc/using-an-animation-control.md)  \n  \n-   [Notifications Sent by Animation Controls](../mfc/notifications-sent-by-animation-controls.md)  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Controls](../mfc/controls-mfc.md)\n\n"}
