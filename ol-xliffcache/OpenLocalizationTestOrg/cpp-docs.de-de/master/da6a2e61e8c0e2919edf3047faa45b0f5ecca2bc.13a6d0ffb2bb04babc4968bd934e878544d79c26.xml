Class\nImplements an OLE control property transferred asynchronously and cached in a memory file.  \n  \n## Syntax  \n  \n```  \nclass CCachedDataPathProperty : public CDataPathProperty  \n```  \n  \n## Members  \n  \n### Public Constructors  \n  \n|Name|Description|  \n|----------|-----------------|  \n|[CCachedDataPathProperty::CCachedDataPathProperty](#ccacheddatapathproperty__ccacheddatapathproperty)|Constructs a `CCachedDataPathProperty` object.|  \n  \n### Public Data Members  \n  \n|Name|Description|  \n|----------|-----------------|  \n|[CCachedDataPathProperty::m_Cache](#ccacheddatapathproperty__m_cache)|`CMemFile` object in which to cache data.|  \n  \n## Remarks  \n A memory file is stored in RAM rather than on disk and is useful for fast temporary transfers.  \n  \n Along with **CAysncMonikerFile** and `CDataPathProperty`, `CCachedDataPathProperty` provides functionality for the use of asynchronous monikers in OLE controls. With `CCachedDataPathProperty` objects, you are able to transfer data asynchronously from a URL or file source and store it in a memory file via the `m_Cache` public variable. All the data is stored in the memory file, and there is no need to override [OnDataAvailable](../../mfc/reference/casyncmonikerfile-class.md#casyncmonikerfile__ondataavailable) unless you want to watch for notifications and respond. For example, if you are transferring a large .GIF file and want to notify your control that more data has arrived and it should redraw itself, override `OnDataAvailable` to make the notification.  \n  \n The class `CCachedDataPathProperty` is derived from `CDataPathProperty`.  \n  \n For more information about how to use asynchronous monikers and ActiveX controls in Internet applications, see the following topics:  \n  \n- [Internet First Steps: ActiveX Controls](../../mfc/activex-controls-on-the-internet.md)  \n  \n- [Internet First Steps: Asynchronous Monikers](../../mfc/asynchronous-monikers-on-the-internet.md)  \n  \n## Inheritance Hierarchy  \n [CObject](../../mfc/reference/cobject-class.md)  \n  \n [CFile](../../mfc/reference/cfile-class.md)  \n  \n [COleStreamFile](../../mfc/reference/colestreamfile-class.md)  \n  \n [CMonikerFile](../../mfc/reference/cmonikerfile-class.md)  \n  \n [CAsyncMonikerFile](../../mfc/reference/casyncmonikerfile-class.md)  \n  \n [CDataPathProperty](../../mfc/reference/cdatapathproperty-class.md)  \n  \n `CCachedDataPathProperty`  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Header:** afxctl.h  \n  \n##  <a name=\"ccacheddatapathproperty__ccacheddatapathproperty\"></a>  CCachedDataPathProperty::CCachedDataPathProperty  \n Constructs a `CCachedDataPathProperty` object.  \n  \n```  \nCCachedDataPathProperty(\n    COleControl* pControl = NULL);\n\n \nCCachedDataPathProperty(\n    LPCTSTR lpszPath,  \n    COleControl* pControl = NULL);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `pControl`  \n A pointer to the ActiveX control object to be associated with this `CCachedDataPathProperty` object.  \n  \n `lpszPath`  \n The path, which may be absolute or relative, used to create an asynchronous moniker that references the actual absolute location of the property. `CCachedDataPathProperty` uses URLs, not filenames. If you want a `CCachedDataPathProperty` object for a file, prepend file:// to the path.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The `COleControl` object pointed to by `pControl` is used by [Open](../../mfc/reference/cdatapathproperty-class.md#cdatapathproperty__open) and retrieved by derived classes. If `pControl` is **NULL**, the control used with **Open** should be set with [SetControl](../../mfc/reference/cdatapathproperty-class.md#cdatapathproperty__setcontrol). If `lpszPath` is **NULL**, you can pass in the path through **Open** or set it with [SetPath](../../mfc/reference/cdatapathproperty-class.md#cdatapathproperty__setpath).  \n  \n##  <a name=\"ccacheddatapathproperty__m_cache\"></a>  CCachedDataPathProperty::m_Cache  \n Contains the class name of the memory file into which data is cached.  \n  \n```  \nCMemFile m_Cache;  \n```  \n  \n### Remarks  \n A memory file is stored in RAM rather than on disk.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [CDataPathProperty Class](../../mfc/reference/cdatapathproperty-class.md)   \n [Hierarchy Chart](../../mfc/hierarchy-chart.md)   \n [CDataPathProperty Class](../../mfc/reference/cdatapathproperty-class.md)\n"}
