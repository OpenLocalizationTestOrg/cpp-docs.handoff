# Configuring Programs for ARM Processors (Visual C++)
This section of the documentation contains information about how to use the Visual C++ build tools to target ARM hardware.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Overview of ARM ABI Conventions](../build/overview-of-arm-abi-conventions.md)  
 Describes the application binary interface used by Windows on ARM for register usage, calling conventions and exception handling.  
  
 [Common Visual C++ ARM Migration Issues](../build/common-visual-cpp-arm-migration-issues.md)  
 Describes C++ code elements that are commonly assumed to be portable across architectures, but which produce different results for ARM than for x86 and x64.  
  
 [ARM Exception Handling](../build/arm-exception-handling.md)  
 Describes the encoding scheme for stack unwinding during structured exception handling in Windows on ARM.
