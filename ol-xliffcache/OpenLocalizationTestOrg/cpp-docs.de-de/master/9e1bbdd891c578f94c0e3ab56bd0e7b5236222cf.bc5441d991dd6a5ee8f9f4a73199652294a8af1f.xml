[CRecordset](../../mfc/reference/crecordset-class.md) and a [CRecordView](../../mfc/reference/crecordview-class.md) form or a [CDaoRecordset](../../mfc/reference/cdaorecordset-class.md) and a [CDaoRecordView](../../mfc/reference/cdaorecordview-class.md) form.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  DDX_Field functions are like DDX functions in that they exchange data with controls in a form. But unlike DDX, they exchange data with the fields of the view's associated recordset object rather than with fields of the record view itself. For more information, see classes `CRecordView` and `CDaoRecordView`.  \n  \n### DDX_Field Functions  \n  \n|||  \n|-|-|  \n|[DDX_FieldCBIndex](#ddx_fieldcbindex)|Transfers integer data between a recordset field data member and the index of the current selection in a combo box in a [CRecordView](../../mfc/reference/crecordview-class.md) or [CDaoRecordView](../../mfc/reference/cdaorecordview-class.md).|  \n|[DDX_FieldCBString](#ddx_fieldcbstring)|Transfers `CString` data between a recordset field data member and the edit control of a combo box in a `CRecordView` or `CDaoRecordView`. When moving data from the recordset to the control, this function selects the item in the combo box that begins with the characters in the specified string.|  \n|[DDX_FieldCBStringExact](#ddx_fieldcbstringexact)|Transfers `CString` data between a recordset field data member and the edit control of a combo box in a `CRecordView` or `CDaoRecordView`. When moving data from the recordset to the control, this function selects the item in the combo box that exactly matches the specified string.|  \n|[DDX_FieldCheck](#ddx_fieldcheck)|Transfers Boolean data between a recordset field data member and a check box in a `CRecordView` or `CDaoRecordView`.|  \n|[DDX_FieldLBIndex](#ddx_fieldlbindex)|Transfers integer data between a recordset field data member and the index of the current selection in a list box in a `CRecordView` or `CDaoRecordView`.|  \n|[DDX_FieldLBString](#ddx_fieldlbstring)|Manages the transfer of [CString](../../atl-mfc-shared/reference/cstringt-class.md) data between a list-box control and the field data members of a recordset. When moving data from the recordset to the control, this function selects the item in the list box that begins with the characters in the specified string.|  \n|[DDX_FieldLBStringExact](#ddx_fieldlbstringexact)|Manages the transfer of `CString` data between a list-box control and the field data members of a recordset. When moving data from the recordset to the control, this function selects the first item that exactly matches the specified string.|  \n|[DDX_FieldRadio](#ddx_fieldradio)|Transfers integer data between a recordset field data member and a group of radio buttons in a `CRecordView` or `CDaoRecordView`.|  \n|[DDX_FieldScroll](#ddx_fieldscroll)|Sets or gets the scroll position of a scroll bar control in a `CRecordView` or `CDaoRecordView`. Call from your [DoFieldExchange](../../mfc/reference/cdaorecordset-class.md#cdaorecordset__dofieldexchange) function.|  \n|[DDX_FieldText](#ddx_fieldtext)|Overloaded versions are available for transferring `int`, **UINT**, **long**, `DWORD`, [CString](../../atl-mfc-shared/reference/cstringt-class.md), **float**, **double**, **short**, [COleDateTime](../../atl-mfc-shared/reference/coledatetime-class.md), and [COleCurrency](../../mfc/reference/colecurrency-class.md) data between a recordset field data member and an edit box in a `CRecordView` or `CDaoRecordView`.|  \n  \n##  <a name=\"ddx_fieldcbindex\"></a>  DDX_FieldCBIndex  \n The `DDX_FieldCBIndex` function synchronizes the index of the selected item in the list box control of a combo box control in a record view and an `int` field data member of a recordset associated with the record view.  \n  \n```  \n \nvoid  \nAFXAPI  \nDDX_FieldCBIndex(\n    CDataExchange* \npDX  ,  \n    int \nnIDC  ,  \n    int& \nindex  ,  \n    CRecordset* pRecordset);\n\nvoid  \nAFXAPI  \nDDX_FieldCBIndex(\n    CDataExchange* \npDX  ,  \n    int \nnIDC  ,  \n    int& \nindex  ,  \n    CDaoRecordset* pRecordset);\n\n \n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `pDX`  \n A pointer to a [CDataExchange](../../mfc/reference/cdataexchange-class.md) object. The framework supplies this object to establish the context of the data exchange, including its direction.  \n  \n `nIDC`  \n The ID of a control in the [CRecordView](../../mfc/reference/crecordview-class.md) or [CDaoRecordView](../../mfc/reference/cdaorecordview-class.md) object.  \n  \n *index*  \n A reference to a field data member in the associated `CRecordset` or `CDaoRecordset` object.  \n  \n `pRecordset`  \n A pointer to the [CRecordset](../../mfc/reference/crecordset-class.md) or [CDaoRecordset](../../mfc/reference/cdaorecordset-class.md) object with which data is exchanged.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n When moving data from the recordset to the control, this function sets the selection in the control based on the value specified in *index*. On a transfer from the recordset to the control, if the recordset field is Null, MFC sets the value of the index to 0. On a transfer from control to recordset, if the control is empty or if no item is selected, the recordset field is set to 0.  \n  \n Use the first version if you are working with the ODBC-based classes. Use the second version if you are working with the DAO-based classes.  \n  \n For more information about DDX, see [Dialog Data Exchange and Validation](../../mfc/dialog-data-exchange-and-validation.md). For examples and more information about DDX for [CRecordView](../../mfc/reference/crecordview-class.md) and [CDaoRecordView](../../mfc/reference/cdaorecordview-class.md) fields, see the article [Record Views](../../data/record-views-mfc-data-access.md).  \n  \n### Example  \n See [DDX_FieldText](#ddx_fieldtext) for a general DDX_Field example.

On a transfer from control to recordset, if the control is empty, the recordset field is set to Null.  \n  \n Use the versions with [CRecordset](../../mfc/reference/crecordset-class.md) parameters if you are working with the ODBC-based classes. Use the versions with [CDaoRecordset](../../mfc/reference/cdaorecordset-class.md) parameters if you are working with the DAO-based classes.  \n  \n For more information about DDX, see [Dialog Data Exchange and Validation](../../mfc/dialog-data-exchange-and-validation.md). For examples and more information about DDX for [CRecordView](../../mfc/reference/crecordview-class.md) and [CDaoRecordView](../../mfc/reference/cdaorecordview-class.md) fields, see the article [Record Views](../../data/record-views-mfc-data-access.md).  \n  \n### Example  \n The following `DoDataExchange` function for a [CRecordView](../../mfc/reference/crecordview-class.md) contains `DDX_FieldText` function calls for three data types: `IDC_COURSELIST` is a combo box; the other two controls are edit boxes. For DAO programming, the *m_pSet* parameter is a pointer to a [CRecordset](../../mfc/reference/crecordset-class.md) or [CDaoRecordset](../../mfc/reference/cdaorecordset-class.md).  \n  \n [!code-cpp[NVC_MFCDatabase#43](../../mfc/codesnippet/cpp/dialog-data-exchange-functions-for-crecordview-and-cdaorecordview_1.cpp)]  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Macros and Globals](../../mfc/reference/mfc-macros-and-globals.md)\n"}
