For example, when the user clicks the mouse, Windows sends several mouse-related messages, such as `WM_LBUTTONDOWN` when the left mouse button is pressed and `WM_LBUTTONUP` when the left mouse button is released. The framework's implementation of the application message loop dispatches the message to the appropriate window.  \n  \n The important categories of messages are described in [Message Categories](../mfc/message-categories.md).  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Messages and Commands in the Framework](../mfc/messages-and-commands-in-the-framework.md)\n\n"}
