The type information for the source interface must be in the same type library as the type information for `IDispatch`.  \n  \n### Example  \n The example below shows how you might define an event sink class, `CEasySink`, that reduces the number of template arguments that you can pass to `IDispEventImpl` to the bare essentials. `EasyAdvise` and `EasyUnadvise` use `AtlGetObjectSourceInterface` to initialize the [IDispEventImpl](../../atl/reference/idispeventimpl-class.md) members before calling [DispEventAdvise](idispeventsimpleimpl-class.md#idispeventsimpleimpl__dispeventadvise) or [DispEventUnadvise](idispeventsimpleimpl-class.md#idispeventsimpleimpl__dispeventunadvise).  \n  \n [!code-cpp[NVC_ATL_Windowing#93](../../atl/codesnippet/cpp/composite-control-global-functions_1.h)]  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Functions](../../atl/reference/atl-functions.md)   \n [Composite Control Macros](../../atl/reference/composite-control-macros.md)\n"}
