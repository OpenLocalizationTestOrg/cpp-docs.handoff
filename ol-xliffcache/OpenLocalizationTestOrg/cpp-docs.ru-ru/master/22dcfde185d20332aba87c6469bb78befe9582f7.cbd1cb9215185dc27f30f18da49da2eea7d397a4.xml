The [CPen::CreatePenIndirect](../../mfc/reference/cpen-class.md#cpen__createpenindirect) function uses the `LOGPEN` structure.  \n  \n## Syntax  \n  \n```  \ntypedef struct tagLOGPEN {  /* lgpn */  \n    UINT lopnStyle;  \n    POINT lopnWidth;  \n    COLORREF lopnColor;  \n} LOGPEN;  \n```  \n  \n#### Parameters  \n *lopnStyle*  \n Specifies the pen type. This member can be one of the following values:  \n  \n- **PS_SOLID** Creates a solid pen.  \n  \n- **PS_DASH** Creates a dashed pen. (Valid only when the pen width is 1.)  \n  \n- **PS_DOT** Creates a dotted pen. (Valid only when the pen width is 1.)  \n  \n- **PS_DASHDOT** Creates a pen with alternating dashes and dots. (Valid only when the pen width is 1.)  \n  \n- **PS_DASHDOTDOT** Creates a pen with alternating dashes and double dots. (Valid only when the pen width is 1.)  \n  \n- **PS_NULL** Creates a null pen.  \n  \n- **PS_INSIDEFRAME** Creates a pen that draws a line inside the frame of closed shapes produced by GDI output functions that specify a bounding rectangle (for example, the **Ellipse**, **Rectangle**, `RoundRect`, `Pie`, and `Chord` member functions). When this style is used with GDI output functions that do not specify a bounding rectangle (for example, the `LineTo` member function), the drawing area of the pen is not limited by a frame.  \n  \n     If a pen has the **PS_INSIDEFRAME** style and a color that does not match a color in the logical color table, the pen is drawn with a dithered color. The **PS_SOLID** pen style cannot be used to create a pen with a dithered color. The **PS_INSIDEFRAME** style is identical to **PS_SOLID** if the pen width is less than or equal to 1.  \n  \n     When the **PS_INSIDEFRAME** style is used with GDI objects produced by functions other than **Ellipse**, **Rectangle**, and `RoundRect`, the line may not be completely inside the specified frame.  \n  \n *lopnWidth*  \n Specifies the pen width, in logical units. If the **lopnWidth** member is 0, the pen is 1 pixel wide on raster devices regardless of the current mapping mode.  \n  \n *lopnColor*  \n Specifies the pen color.  \n  \n## Remarks  \n The **y** value in the [POINT](../../mfc/reference/point-structure1.md) structure for the **lopnWidth** member is not used.  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Header:** wingdi.h  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Structures, Styles, Callbacks, and Message Maps](../../mfc/reference/structures-styles-callbacks-and-message-maps.md)   \n [CPen::CreatePenIndirect](../../mfc/reference/cpen-class.md#cpen__createpenindirect)\n\n"}
