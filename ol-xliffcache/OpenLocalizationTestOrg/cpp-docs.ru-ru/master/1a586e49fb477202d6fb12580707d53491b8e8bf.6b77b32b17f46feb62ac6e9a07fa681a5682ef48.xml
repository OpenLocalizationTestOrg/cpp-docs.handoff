It can be used to store characters from the ASCII character set or any of the ISO-8859 character sets, or the UTF-8 character set. The type `unsigned char` is often used to represent a *byte* which is not a built-in type in C++. The char type is not suitable for text in many languages. In general, modern programs should use one of the wide character types to represent text. Unicode is the  \n  \n In the C++ standard library, the basic_string type is specialized for both narrow and wide strings. Use std::string when the characters are of type char, and std::wstring when the characters are of type wchar_t. Other types that represent text, including std::stringstream and std::cout have specializations for narrow and wide strings.  \n  \n## Requirements"}
