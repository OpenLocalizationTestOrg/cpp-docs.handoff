To terminate the thread, call [CWorkerThread::Shutdown](#cworkerthread__shutdown).  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Header:** atlutil.h  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cworkerthread__addhandle\"></a>  CWorkerThread::AddHandle  \n Call this method to add a waitable object's handle to the list maintained by the worker thread.  \n  \n```\nHRESULT AddHandle(\n    HANDLE hObject,\n    IWorkerThreadClient* pClient,\n    DWORD_PTR dwParam) throw();\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `hObject`  \n The handle to a waitable object.  \n  \n `pClient`  \n The pointer to the [IWorkerThreadClient](../../atl/reference/iworkerthreadclient-interface.md) interface on the object to be called when the handle is signaled.  \n  \n `dwParam`  \n The parameter to be passed to [IWorkerThreadClient::Execute](../../atl/reference/iworkerthreadclient-interface.md#iworkerthreadclient__execute) when the handle is signaled.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Returns S_OK on success, or an error HRESULT on failure.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n [IWorkerThreadClient::Execute](../../atl/reference/iworkerthreadclient-interface.md#iworkerthreadclient__execute) will be called through `pClient` when the handle, `hObject`, is signaled.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cworkerthread__addtimer\"></a>  CWorkerThread::AddTimer  \n Call this method to add a periodic waitable timer to the list maintained by the worker thread.  \n  \n```\nHRESULT AddTimer(\n    DWORD dwInterval,\n    IWorkerThreadClient* pClient,\n    DWORD_PTR dwParam,\n    HANDLE* phTimer) throw();\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n *dwInterval*  \n Specifies the period of the timer in milliseconds.  \n  \n `pClient`  \n The pointer to the [IWorkerThreadClient](../../atl/reference/iworkerthreadclient-interface.md) interface on the object to be called when the handle is signaled.  \n  \n `dwParam`  \n The parameter to be passed to [IWorkerThreadClient::Execute](../../atl/reference/iworkerthreadclient-interface.md#iworkerthreadclient__execute) when the handle is signaled.  \n  \n `phTimer`  \n [out] Address of the HANDLE variable that, on success, receives the handle to the newly created timer.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Returns S_OK on success, or an error HRESULT on failure.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n [IWorkerThreadClient::Execute](../../atl/reference/iworkerthreadclient-interface.md#iworkerthreadclient__execute) will be called through `pClient` when the timer is signaled.  \n  \n Pass the timer handle from `phTimer` to [CWorkerThread::RemoveHandle](#cworkerthread__removehandle) to close the timer.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cworkerthread__cworkerthread\"></a>  CWorkerThread::CWorkerThread  \n The constructor.  \n  \n```\nCWorkerThread() throw();\n```  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cworkerthread___dtorcworkerthread\"></a>  CWorkerThread::~CWorkerThread  \n The destructor.  \n  \n```\n~CWorkerThread() throw();\n```  \n  \n### Remarks  \n Calls [CWorkerThread::Shutdown](#cworkerthread__shutdown).  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cworkerthread__getthreadhandle\"></a>  CWorkerThread::GetThreadHandle  \n Call this method to get the thread handle of the worker thread.  \n  \n```\nHANDLE GetThreadHandle() throw();\n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Returns the thread handle or NULL if the worker thread has not been initialized.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cworkerthread__getthreadid\"></a>  CWorkerThread::GetThreadId  \n Call this method to get the thread ID of the worker thread.  \n  \n```\nDWORD GetThreadId() throw();\n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Returns the thread ID or NULL if the worker thread has not been initialized.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cworkerthread__initialize\"></a>  CWorkerThread::Initialize  \n Call this method to initialize the worker thread.  \n  \n```\nHRESULT Initialize() throw();\nHRESULT Initialize(CWorkerThread<ThreadTraits>* pThread) throw();\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `pThread`  \n An existing worker thread.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Returns S_OK on success, or an error HRESULT on failure.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n This method should be called to initialize the object after creation or after a call to [CWorkerThread::Shutdown](#cworkerthread__shutdown).  \n  \n To have two or more `CWorkerThread` objects use the same worker thread, initialize one of them without passing any arguments then pass a pointer to that object to the `Initialize` methods of the others. The objects initialized using the pointer should be shut down before the object used to initialize them.  \n  \n See [CWorkerThread::Shutdown](#cworkerthread__shutdown) for information on how that method's behavior changes when initialized using a pointer to an existing object.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cworkerthread__removehandle\"></a>  CWorkerThread::RemoveHandle  \n Call this method to remove a handle from the list of waitable objects.  \n  \n```\nHRESULT RemoveHandle(HANDLE   hObject) throw();\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `hObject`  \n The handle to remove.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Returns S_OK on success, or an error HRESULT on failure.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n When the handle is removed [IWorkerThreadClient::CloseHandle](../../atl/reference/iworkerthreadclient-interface.md#iworkerthreadclient__closehandle) will be called on the associated object that was passed to [AddHandle](#cworkerthread__addhandle). If this call fails, `CWorkerThread` will call the Windows [CloseHandle](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms724211) function on the handle.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cworkerthread__shutdown\"></a>  CWorkerThread::Shutdown  \n Call this method to shut down the worker thread.  \n  \n```\nHRESULT Shutdown(DWORD   dwWait = ATL_WORKER_THREAD_WAIT) throw();\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `dwWait`  \n The time in milliseconds to wait for the worker thread to shut down.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Returns S_OK on success, or an error HRESULT on failure, such as if the timeout value, `dwWait`, is exceeded.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n To reuse the object, call [CWorkerThread::Initialize](#cworkerthread__initialize) after calling this method.  \n  \n Note that calling **Shutdown** on an object initialized with a pointer to another `CWorkerThread` object has no effect and always returns S_OK.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [DefaultThreadTraits](atl-typedefs.md#defaultthreadtraits)   \n [Classes](../../atl/reference/atl-classes.md)   \n [Multithreading: Creating Worker Threads](../../parallel/multithreading-creating-worker-threads.md)   \n [IWorkerThreadClient Interface](../../atl/reference/iworkerthreadclient-interface.md)\n"}
