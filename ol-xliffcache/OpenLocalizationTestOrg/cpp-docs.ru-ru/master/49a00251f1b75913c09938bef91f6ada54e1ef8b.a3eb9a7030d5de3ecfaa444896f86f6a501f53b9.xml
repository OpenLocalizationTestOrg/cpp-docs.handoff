In addition, from the Toolbox, you can define events for ActiveX controls.  \n  \n For ATL- and MFC-based COM object classes, you can edit the class implementation at the same time that you edit the interface.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  For interfaces that you have defined outside of the **Add Class** dialog box, Visual C++ adds the methods or properties to the .idl file, and it add stubs to the classes that implement methods, even when the interfaces are added manually.  \n  \n The following three wizards help you customize existing interfaces. They are available from Class View:  \n  \n|Wizard|Project type|  \n|------------|------------------|  \n|[Add Property Wizard](../ide/names-add-property-wizard.md)|ATL or MFC projects supporting ATL.
