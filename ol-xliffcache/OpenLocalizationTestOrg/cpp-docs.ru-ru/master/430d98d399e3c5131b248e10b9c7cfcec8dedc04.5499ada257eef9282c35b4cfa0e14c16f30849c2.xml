Because of this similarity, you can use the `CObList` reference documentation for member function specifics. Wherever you see a `CObject` pointer as a function parameter or return value, substitute a pointer to `void`.  \n  \n `CObject*& CObList::GetHead() const;`  \n  \n for example, translates to  \n  \n `void*& CPtrList::GetHead() const;`  \n  \n## Remarks  \n `CPtrList` incorporates the `IMPLEMENT_DYNAMIC` macro to support run-time type access and dumping to a `CDumpContext` object. If you need a dump of individual pointer list elements, you must set the depth of the dump context to 1 or greater.  \n  \n Pointer lists cannot be serialized.  \n  \n When a `CPtrList` object is deleted, or when its elements are removed, only the pointers are removed, not the entities they reference.  \n  \n For more information on using `CPtrList`, see the article [Collections](../../mfc/collections.md).  \n  \n## Inheritance Hierarchy  \n [CObject](../../mfc/reference/cobject-class.md)  \n  \n `CPtrList`  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Header:** afxcoll.h  \n  \n## See Also  \n [CObject Class](../../mfc/reference/cobject-class.md)   \n [Hierarchy Chart](../../mfc/hierarchy-chart.md)   \n [CObList Class](../../mfc/reference/coblist-class.md)\n"}
