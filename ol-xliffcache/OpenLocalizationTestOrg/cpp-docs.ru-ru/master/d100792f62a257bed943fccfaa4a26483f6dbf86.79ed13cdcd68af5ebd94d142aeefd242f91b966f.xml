Written in C++, MFC provides much of the code necessary for managing windows, menus, and dialog boxes; performing basic input/output; storing collections of data objects; and so on. All you need to do is add your application-specific code into this framework. Given the nature of C++ class programming, it is easy to extend or override the basic functionality that [the MFC framework](../mfc/framework-mfc.md) supplies.  \n  \n The MFC framework is a powerful approach that lets you build upon the work of expert programmers for Windows. MFC shortens development time; makes code more portable; provides tremendous support without reducing programming freedom and flexibility; and gives easy access to \"hard to program\" user-interface elements and technologies, like Active technology, OLE, and Internet programming. Furthermore, MFC simplifies database programming through Data Access Objects (DAO) and Open Database Connectivity (ODBC), and network programming through Windows Sockets. MFC makes it easy to program features like property sheets (\"tab dialogs\"), print preview, and floating, customizable toolbars.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n `MFC Samples`, which are supplied in [Visual C++ Samples](../visual-cpp-samples.md)  \n  \n [Using the MFC Source Files](../mfc/using-the-mfc-source-files.md)  \n  \n [MFC Library Versions](../mfc/mfc-library-versions.md)  \n  \n [Using the Classes to Write Applications for Windows](../mfc/using-the-classes-to-write-applications-for-windows.md)  \n  \n [Building on the Framework](../mfc/building-on-the-framework.md)  \n  \n [CWinApp: The Application Class](../mfc/cwinapp-the-application-class.md)  \n  \n [Document Templates and the Document/View Creation Process](../mfc/document-templates-and-the-document-view-creation-process.md)  \n  \n [Managing the State Data of MFC Modules](../mfc/managing-the-state-data-of-mfc-modules.md)  \n  \n [Idle Loop Processing](../mfc/idle-loop-processing.md)  \n  \n [Support for Activation Contexts in the MFC Module State](../mfc/support-for-activation-contexts-in-the-mfc-module-state.md)  \n  \n [Isolation of the MFC Common Controls Library](../mfc/isolation-of-the-mfc-common-controls-library.md)  \n  \n [Build Requirements for Windows Vista Common Controls](../mfc/build-requirements-for-windows-vista-common-controls.md)  \n  \n [How to: Add Restart Manager Support](../mfc/how-to-add-restart-manager-support.md)  \n  \n [Dynamic Layout](../mfc/dynamic-layout.md)  \n  \n For an overview of the MFC reference documentation, see [Microsoft Foundation Class Library](../mfc/mfc-desktop-applications.md).  \n  \n For information about ATL, see [Active Template Library Reference](../atl/atl-class-overview.md).  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Working with Window Objects](../mfc/working-with-window-objects.md)\n\n"}
