A universal character name cannot contain a value in the Unicode surrogate range, D800-DFFF, or an encoded surrogate pair. The compiler generates the surrogate pair from a valid code point automatically.  \n  \n In code compiled as C, a universal character name may not represent a character in the range 0000-009F, inclusive, with the exceptions of 0024 ('$'), 0040 ('@') and 0060 ('`').  \n  \n In code compiled as C++, a universal character name may use any valid Unicode code point in a string or character literal. Outside of a literal, a universal character name may not represent a control character in the ranges 0000-001F or 007F-009F, both inclusive, or a member of the basic source character set.  For more information, see [Character Sets](../../cpp/character-sets2.md).  \n  \n## Example  \n The following sample generates C3850, and shows how to fix it:  \n  \n```cpp  \n// C3850.cpp  \nint main() {  \n   int \\u0019 = 0;   // C3850, not in allowed range for an identifier  \n   const wchar_t * wstr_bad  = L\"\\UD840DC8A\"; // C3850, UCN is surrogate pair  \n   const wchar_t * wstr_good = L\"\\U0002008A\"; // Okay, UCN is valid code point  \n}  \n```"}
