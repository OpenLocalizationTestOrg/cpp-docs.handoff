[Select the controls](../mfc/selecting-multiple-controls.md) you want to align. Be sure to select the control that you want to be the dominant control first or set it to be the dominant control before executing the alignment or sizing command.  \n  \n     The final position of the group of controls depends on the position of the dominant control. For more information on selecting the dominant control, see [Specifying the Dominant Control](../mfc/specifying-the-dominant-control.md).  \n  \n2.  From the **Format** menu, choose **Align**, and then choose one of the following alignments:  \n  \n    -   **Lefts**: aligns the selected controls along their left sides.  \n  \n    -   **Centers**: aligns the selected controls horizontally along their center points.  \n  \n    -   **Rights**: aligns the selected controls along their right sides.  \n  \n    -   **Tops**: aligns the selected controls along their top edges.  \n  \n    -   **Middles**: aligns the selected controls vertically along their middle points.  \n  \n    -   **Bottoms**: aligns the selected controls along their bottom edges.  \n  \n For information on adding resources to managed projects, please see [Resources in Applications](http://msdn.microsoft.com/Library/8ad495d4-2941-40cf-bf64-e82e85825890) in the *.NET Framework Developer's Guide.* For information on manually adding resource files to managed projects, accessing resources, displaying static resources, and assigning resources strings to properties, see [Walkthrough: Localizing Windows Forms](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/9a96220d-a19b-4de0-9f48-01e5d82679e5) and [Walkthrough: Using Resources for Localization with ASP.NET](http://msdn.microsoft.com/Library/bb4e5b44-e2b0-48ab-bbe9-609fb33900b6).  \n  \n Requirements  \n  \n Win32  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Arrangement of Controls on Dialog Boxes](../mfc/arrangement-of-controls-on-dialog-boxes.md)   \n [Controls in Dialog Boxes](../mfc/controls-in-dialog-boxes.md)   \n [Controls](../mfc/controls-mfc.md)\n\n"}
