Its representation has at least 32 value bits. It is not necessarily large enough to represent an arbitrary byte position within a stream. The value **streamoff(-1)** generally indicates an erroneous offset.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"streampos\"></a>  streampos  \n Holds the current position of the buffer pointer or file pointer.  \n  \n```  \ntypedef fpos<mbstate_t> streampos;  \n```  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The type is a synonym for [fpos](../standard-library/fpos-class.md)< `mbstate_t`>.  \n  \n### Example  \n  \n```cpp  \n// ios_streampos.cpp  \n// compile with: /EHsc  \n#include <iostream>  \n#include <fstream>  \n  \nint main( )   \n{  \n   using namespace std;  \n  \n   ofstream x( \"iostream.txt\" );  \n   x << \"testing\";  \n   streampos y = x.tellp( );  \n   cout << y << endl;  \n}  \n```  \n  \n```Output  \n7  \n```  \n  \n##  <a name=\"streamsize\"></a>  streamsize  \n Denotes the size of the stream.  \n  \n```  \n#ifdef _WIN64  \n    typedef __int64 streamsize;  \n#else  \n    typedef int streamsize;  \n#endif  \n```  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The type is a signed integer that describes an object that can store a count of the number of elements involved in various stream operations. Its representation has at least 16 bits. It is not necessarily large enough to represent an arbitrary byte position within a stream.  \n  \n### Example  \n  After compiling and running the following program, look at the file test.txt to see the effect of setting `streamsize`.  \n  \n```  \n// ios_streamsize.cpp  \n// compile with: /EHsc  \n#include <iostream>  \n#include <fstream>  \n  \nint main( )   \n{  \n   using namespace std;  \n   char a[16] = \"any such text\";  \n   ofstream x( \"test.txt\" );  \n   streamsize y = 6;  \n   x.write( a, y );  \n}  \n```  \n  \n##  <a name=\"wios\"></a>  wios  \n Supports the wios class from the old iostream library.  \n  \n```  \ntypedef basic_ios<wchar_t, char_traits<wchar_t>> wios;  \n```  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The type is a synonym for template class [basic_ios](../standard-library/basic-ios-class.md), specialized for elements of type `wchar_t` with default character traits.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"wstreampos\"></a>  wstreampos  \n Holds the current position of the buffer pointer or file pointer.  \n  \n```  \ntypedef fpos<mbstate_t> wstreampos;  \n```  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The type is a synonym for [fpos](../standard-library/fpos-class.md)< `mbstate_t`>.  \n  \n### Example  \n  \n```cpp  \n// ios_wstreampos.cpp  \n// compile with: /EHsc  \n#include <iostream>  \n#include <fstream>  \n  \nint main( )   \n{  \n   using namespace std;  \n   wofstream xw( \"wiostream.txt\" );  \n   xw << L\"testing\";  \n   wstreampos y = xw.tellp( );  \n   cout << y << endl;  \n}  \n```  \n  \n```Output  \n7  \n```  \n  \n## See Also  \n [\\<ios>](../standard-library/ios.md)\n\n"}
