double&gt;\nDescribes an object that stores an ordered pair of objects both of type `long double`, the first representing the real part of a complex number and the second representing the imaginary part.  \n  \n## Syntax  \n  \n```\ntemplate <>\nclass complex<long double> {\npublic:\n    constexpr complex(\n    long double _RealVal = 0,\n    long double _ImagVal = 0);\n\ncomplex(\n    constexpr complex<long double>& complexNum);\n// rest same as template class complex\n};\n```  \n  \n#### Parameters  \n `_RealVal`  \n The value of type **long double** for the real part of the complex number being constructed.  \n  \n `_ImagVal`  \n The value of type `long double` for the imaginary part of the complex number being constructed.  \n  \n ` complexNum`  \n The complex number of type **double** or of type **float** whose real and imaginary parts are used to initialize a complex number of type `long double` being constructed.  \n  \n## Return Value  \n A complex number of type `long double`.  \n  \n## Remarks  \n The explicit specialization of the template class complex to a complex class of type `long double` differs from the template class only in the constructors it defines. The conversion from `long double` to **float** is allowed to be implicit, but the conversion from **double** to `long double` is required to be **explicit**. The use of **explicit** rules out the initiation with type conversion using assignment syntax.  \n  \n For more information on the template class `complex`, see [complex Class](../standard-library/complex-class.md). For a list of members of the template class `complex`, see .  \n  \n## Example  \n  \n```cpp  \n// complex_comp_ld.cpp  \n// compile with: /EHsc  \n#include <complex>  \n#include <iostream>  \n  \nint main( )  \n{  \n   using namespace std;  \n   double pi = 3.14159265359;  \n  \n   // The first constructor specifies real & imaginary parts  \n   complex <long double> c1 ( 4.0 , 5.0 );  \n   cout << \"Specifying initial real & imaginary parts,\\n\"  \n        << \" as type float gives c1 = \" << c1 << endl;  \n  \n   // The second constructor initializes values of the real &  \n   // imaginary parts using those of complex number of type float  \n   complex <float> c2float ( 1.0 , 3.0 );  \n   complex <long double> c2longdouble ( c2float );  \n   cout << \"Implicit conversion from type float to type long double,\"  \n        << \"\\n gives c2longdouble = \" << c2longdouble << endl;  \n  \n   // The third constructor initializes values of the real &  \n   // imaginary parts using those of a complex number  \n   // of type double  \n   complex <double> c3double ( 3.0 , 4.0 );  \n   complex <long double> c3longdouble ( c3double );  \n   cout << \"Implicit conversion from type long double to type float,\"  \n        << \"\\n gives c3longdouble = \" << c3longdouble << endl;  \n  \n   // The modulus and argument of a complex number can be recovered  \n   double absc3 = abs ( c3longdouble );  \n   double argc3 = arg ( c3longdouble );  \n   cout << \"The modulus of c3 is recovered from c3 using: abs ( c3 ) = \"  \n        << absc3 << endl;  \n   cout << \"Argument of c3 is recovered from c3 using:\\n arg ( c3 ) = \"  \n        << argc3 << \" radians, which is \" << argc3 * 180 / pi  \n        << \" degrees.\" << endl;  \n}  \n\\* Output:   \nSpecifying initial real & imaginary parts,  \n as type float gives c1 = (4,5)  \nImplicit conversion from type float to type long double,  \n gives c2longdouble = (1,3)  \nImplicit conversion from type long double to type float,  \n gives c3longdouble = (3,4)  \nThe modulus of c3 is recovered from c3 using: abs ( c3 ) = 5  \nArgument of c3 is recovered from c3 using:  \n arg ( c3 ) = 0.927295 radians, which is 53.1301 degrees.  \n*\\  \n```  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Header**: \\<complex>  \n  \n **Namespace:** std  \n  \n## See Also  \n [complex Class](../standard-library/complex-class.md)   \n [Thread Safety in the C++ Standard Library](../standard-library/thread-safety-in-the-cpp-standard-library.md)\n\n\n\n"}
