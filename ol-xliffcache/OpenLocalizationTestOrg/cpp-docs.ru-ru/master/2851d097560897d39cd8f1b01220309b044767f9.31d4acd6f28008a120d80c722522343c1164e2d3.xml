bitmap format (.bmp). You can, however, save the image as a GIF or JPEG or in other graphic formats.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  This process does not apply to icons and cursors.  \n  \n### To create and save a bitmap as a .gif or .jpeg  \n  \n1.  From the **File** menu, choose **Open**, then click **File**.  \n  \n2.  In the **New File dialog box**, click the **Visual C++** folder, then select **Bitmap File (.bmp)** in the **Templates** box and click **Open**.  \n  \n     The bitmap opens in the **Image** editor.  \n  \n3.  Make changes to your new bitmap as needed.  \n  \n4.  With the bitmap still open in the **Image** editor, click **Save *filename*.bmp As** on the **File** menu.  \n  \n5.  In the **Save File As** dialog box, type the name you want to give the file and the extension that denotes the file format you want in the **File Name** box. For example, myfile.gif.  \n  \n     **Note**  You must create or open the bitmap outside of your project in order to save it as another file format. If you create or open it within your project, the **Save As** command will be unavailable. For more information, see [Viewing Resources in a Resource Script File Outside of a Project (Standalone)](../windows/how-to-open-a-resource-script-file-outside-of-a-project-standalone.md).  \n  \n6.  Click **Save**.  \n  \n For information on adding resources to managed projects, please see [Resources in Applications](http://msdn.microsoft.com/Library/8ad495d4-2941-40cf-bf64-e82e85825890) in the *.NET Framework Developer's Guide.* For information on manually adding resource files to managed projects, accessing resources, displaying static resources, and assigning resources strings to properties, see [Walkthrough: Localizing Windows Forms](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/9a96220d-a19b-4de0-9f48-01e5d82679e5) and [Walkthrough: Using Resources for Localization with ASP.NET](http://msdn.microsoft.com/Library/bb4e5b44-e2b0-48ab-bbe9-609fb33900b6).  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Editing Graphical Resources](../mfc/editing-graphical-resources-image-editor-for-icons.md)   \n [Image Editor for Icons](../mfc/image-editor-for-icons.md)\n\n"}
