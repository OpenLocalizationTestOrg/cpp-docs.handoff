CWordArray : public CObject  \n```  \n  \n## Members  \n The member functions of `CWordArray` are similar to the member functions of class [CObArray](../../mfc/reference/cobarray-class.md). Because of this similarity, you can use the `CObArray` reference documentation for member function specifics. Wherever you see a [CObject](../../mfc/reference/cobject-class.md) pointer as a function parameter or return value, substitute a **WORD**.  \n  \n `CObject* CObArray::GetAt( int <nIndex> ) const;`  \n  \n for example, translates to  \n  \n `WORD CWordArray::GetAt( int <nIndex> ) const;`  \n  \n### Public Constructors  \n  \n|Name|Description|  \n|----------|-----------------|  \n|[CObArray::CObArray](../../mfc/reference/cobarray-class.md#cobarray__cobarray)|Constructs an empty array.|  \n  \n### Public Methods  \n  \n|Name|Description|  \n|----------|-----------------|  \n|[CObArray::Add](../../mfc/reference/cobarray-class.md#cobarray__add)|Adds an element to the end of the array; grows the array if necessary.|  \n|[CObArray::Append](../../mfc/reference/cobarray-class.md#cobarray__append)|Appends another array to the array; grows the array if necessary.|  \n|[CObArray::Copy](../../mfc/reference/cobarray-class.md#cobarray__copy)|Copies another array to the array; grows the array if necessary.|  \n|[CObArray::ElementAt](../../mfc/reference/cobarray-class.md#cobarray__elementat)|Returns a temporary reference to the element pointer within the array.|  \n|[CObArray::FreeExtra](../../mfc/reference/cobarray-class.md#cobarray__freeextra)|Frees all unused memory above the current upper bound.|  \n|[CObArray::GetAt](../../mfc/reference/cobarray-class.md#cobarray__getat)|Returns the value at a given index.|  \n|[CObArray::GetCount](../../mfc/reference/cobarray-class.md#cobarray__getcount)|Gets the number of elements in this array.|  \n|[CObArray::GetData](../../mfc/reference/cobarray-class.md#cobarray__getdata)|Allows access to elements in the array. Can be **NULL**.|  \n|[CObArray::GetSize](../../mfc/reference/cobarray-class.md#cobarray__getsize)|Gets the number of elements in this array.|  \n|[CObArray::GetUpperBound](../../mfc/reference/cobarray-class.md#cobarray__getupperbound)|Returns the largest valid index.|  \n|[CObArray::InsertAt](../../mfc/reference/cobarray-class.md#cobarray__insertat)|Inserts an element (or all the elements in another array) at a specified index.|  \n|[CObArray::IsEmpty](../../mfc/reference/cobarray-class.md#cobarray__isempty)|Determines if the array is empty.|  \n|[CObArray::RemoveAll](../../mfc/reference/cobarray-class.md#cobarray__removeall)|Removes all the elements from this array.|  \n|[CObArray::RemoveAt](../../mfc/reference/cobarray-class.md#cobarray__removeat)|Removes an element at a specific index.|  \n|[CObArray::SetAt](../../mfc/reference/cobarray-class.md#cobarray__setat)|Sets the value for a given index; array not allowed to grow.|  \n|[CObArray::SetAtGrow](../../mfc/reference/cobarray-class.md#cobarray__setatgrow)|Sets the value for a given index; grows the array if necessary.|  \n|[CObArray::SetSize](../../mfc/reference/cobarray-class.md#cobarray__setsize)|Sets the number of elements to be contained in this array.|  \n  \n### Public Operators  \n  \n|Name|Description|  \n|----------|-----------------|  \n|[CObArray::operator &#91;&#93;](../../mfc/reference/cobarray-class.md#cobarray__operator_at)|Sets or gets the element at the specified index.|  \n  \n## Remarks  \n `CWordArray` incorporates the [IMPLEMENT_SERIAL](run-time-object-model-services.md#implement_serial) macro to support serialization and dumping of its elements. If an array of words is stored to an archive, either with an overloaded insertion operator or with the [CObject::Serialize](../../mfc/reference/cobject-class.md#cobject__serialize) member function, each element is, in turn, serialized.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  Before using an array, use `SetSize` to establish its size and allocate memory for it. If you do not use `SetSize`, adding elements to your array causes it to be frequently reallocated and copied. Frequent reallocation and copying are inefficient and can fragment memory.  \n  \n If you need a dump of individual elements in the array, you must set the depth of the dump context to 1 or greater.  \n  \n For more information on using `CWordArray`, see the article [Collections](../../mfc/collections.md).  \n  \n## Inheritance Hierarchy  \n [CObject](../../mfc/reference/cobject-class.md)  \n  \n `CWordArray`  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Header:** afxcoll.h  \n  \n##  <a name=\"icommandsource_interface\"></a>  ICommandSource Interface  \n Manages commands sent from a command source object to a user control.  \n  \n```  \ninterface class ICommandSource  \n```  \n  \n### Remarks  \n When you host a user control in an MFC View, [CWinFormsView Class](../../mfc/reference/cwinformsview-class.md) routes commands and update command UI messages to the user control to allow it to handle MFC commands (for example, frame menu items and toolbar buttons). By implementing  , you give the user control a reference to the `ICommandSource` object.  \n  \n See [How to: Add Command Routing to the Windows Forms Control](../../dotnet/how-to-add-command-routing-to-the-windows-forms-control.md) for an example of how to use `ICommandTarget`.  \n  \n For more information on using Windows Forms, see [Using a Windows Form User Control in MFC](../../dotnet/using-a-windows-form-user-control-in-mfc.md).  \n  \n##  <a name=\"icommandsource__addcommandhandler\"></a>  ICommandSource::AddCommandHandler  \n Adds a command handler to a command source object.  \n  \n```  \nvoid AddCommandHandler(\n    unsigned int cmdID,  \n    CommandHandler^ cmdHandler);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `cmdID`  \n The command ID.  \n  \n `cmdHandler`  \n A handle to the command handler method.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n This method adds the command handler `cmdHandler` to the command source object and maps the handler to `cmdID`.  \n  \n See [How to: Add Command Routing to the Windows Forms Control](../../dotnet/how-to-add-command-routing-to-the-windows-forms-control.md) for an example of how to use `AddCommandHandler`.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"icommandsource__addcommandrangehandler\"></a>  ICommandSource::AddCommandRangeHandler  \n Adds a group of command handlers to a command source object.  \n  \n```  \nvoid AddCommandRangeHandler(\n    unsigned int cmdIDMin,  \n    unsigned int cmdIDMax,  \n    CommandHandler^ cmdHandler);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `cmdIDMin`  \n The beginning index of the command ID range.  \n  \n `cmdIDMax`  \n The ending index of the command ID range.  \n  \n `cmdHandler`  \n A handle to the message handler method to which the commands are mapped.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n This method maps a contiguous range of command IDs to a single message handler and adds it to the command source object. This is used for handling a group of related buttons with one method.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"icommandsource__addcommandrangeuihandler\"></a>  ICommandSource::AddCommandRangeUIHandler  \n Adds a group of user interface command message handlers to a command source object.  \n  \n```  \nvoid AddCommandRangeUIHandler(\n    unsigned int cmdIDMin,   \n    unsigned int cmdIDMax,   \n    CommandUIHandler^ cmdUIHandler);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `cmdIDMin`  \n The beginning index of the command ID range.  \n  \n `cmdIDMax`  \n The ending index of the command ID range.  \n  \n `cmdHandler`  \n A handle to the message handler method to which the commands are mapped.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n This method maps a contiguous range of command IDs to a single user interface command message handler and adds it to the command source object.

It calls [CWnd::PostMessage](../../mfc/reference/cwnd-class.md#cwnd__postmessage) to place the message in the window's message queue and then returns without waiting for the corresponding window to process the message.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"icommandsource__removecommandhandler\"></a>  ICommandSource::RemoveCommandHandler  \n Removes a command handler from a command source object.  \n  \n```  \nvoid RemoveCommandHandler(unsigned int cmdID);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `cmdID`  \n The command ID.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n This method removes the command handler mapped to `cmdID` from the command source object.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"icommandsource__removecommandrangehandler\"></a>  ICommandSource::RemoveCommandRangeHandler  \n Removes a group of command handlers from a command source object.  \n  \n```  \nvoid RemoveCommandRangeUIHandler(\n    unsigned int cmdIDMin,  \n    unsigned int cmdIDMax);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `cmdIDMin`  \n The beginning index of the command ID range.  \n  \n `cmdIDMax`  \n The ending index of the command ID range.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n This method removes a group of message handlers, mapped to the command IDs specifed by `cmdIDMin` and `cmdIDMax`, from the command source object.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"icommandsource__removecommandrangeuihandler\"></a>  ICommandSource::RemoveCommandRangeUIHandler  \n Removes a group of user interface command message handlers from a command source object.  \n  \n```  \nvoid RemoveCommandRangeUIHandler(\n    unsigned int cmdIDMin,  \n    unsigned int cmdIDMax);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `cmdIDMin`  \n The beginning index of the command ID range.  \n  \n `cmdIDMax`  \n The ending index of the command ID range.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n This method removes a group of user interface command message handlers, mapped to the command IDs specifed by `cmdIDMin` and `cmdIDMax`, from the command source object.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"icommandsource__removecommanduihandler\"></a>  ICommandSource::RemoveCommandUIHandler  \n Removes a user interface command message handler from a command source object.  \n  \n```  \nvoid RemoveCommandUIHandler(unsigned int cmdID);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `cmdID`  \n The command ID.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n This method removes the user interface command message handler mapped to `cmdID` from the command source object.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"icommandsource__sendcommand\"></a>  ICommandSource::SendCommand  \n Sends a message and waits for it to be processed before returning.  \n  \n```  \nvoid SendCommand(unsigned int command);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `command`  \n The command ID of the message to be sent.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n This method synchronously sends the message mapped to the ID specified by `command`. It calls [CWnd::SendMessage](../../mfc/reference/cwnd-class.md#cwnd__sendmessage) to place the message in the window's message queue and waits until that window procedure has processed the message before returning.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"icommandtarget_interface\"></a>  ICommandTarget Interface  \n Provides a user control with an interface to receive commands from a command source object.  \n  \n```  \ninterface class ICommandTarget  \n```  \n  \n### Remarks  \n When you host a user control in an MFC View, [CWinFormsView](../../mfc/reference/cwinformsview-class.md) routes commands and update command UI messages to the user control to allow it to handle MFC commands (for example, frame menu items and toolbar buttons). By implementing `ICommandTarget`, you give the user control a reference to the  object.  \n  \n See [How to: Add Command Routing to the Windows Forms Control](../../dotnet/how-to-add-command-routing-to-the-windows-forms-control.md) for an example of how to use `ICommandTarget`.  \n  \n For more information on using Windows Forms, see [Using a Windows Form User Control in MFC](../../dotnet/using-a-windows-form-user-control-in-mfc.md).  \n  \n##  <a name=\"icommandtarget__initialize\"></a>  ICommandTarget::Initialize  \n Initializes the command target object.  \n  \n```  \nvoid Initialize(ICommandSource^ cmdSource);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `cmdSource`  \n A handle to the command source object.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n When you host a user control in an MFC View, [CWinFormsView](../../mfc/reference/cwinformsview-class.md) routes commands and update command UI messages to the user control to allow it to handle MFC commands.  \n  \n This method initializes the command target object and associates it with the specified command source object `cmdSource`. It should be called in the user control class implementation. At initialization, you should register command handlers with the command source object by calling [ICommandSource::AddCommandHandler](../../mfc/reference/icommandsource-interface.md) in the `Initialize` implementation. See [How to: Add Command Routing to the Windows Forms Control](../../dotnet/how-to-add-command-routing-to-the-windows-forms-control.md) for an example of how to use `Initialize` to do this.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"icommandui_interface\"></a>  ICommandUI Interface  \n Manages user interface commands.  \n  \n```  \ninterface class ICommandUI  \n```  \n  \n### Remarks  \n This interface provides methods and properties that manage user interface commands. `ICommandUI` is similar to [CCmdUI Class](../../mfc/reference/ccmdui-class.md), except that `ICommandUI` is used for MFC applications that interoperate with .NET components.  \n  \n `ICommandUI` is used within an `ON_UPDATE_COMMAND_UI` handler in an  -derived class. When a user of an application activates (selects or clicks) a menu, each menu item is displayed as enabled or disabled. The target of each menu command provides this information by implementing an `ON_UPDATE_COMMAND_UI` handler. For each of the command user interface objects in your application, use the Properties window to create a message-map entry and function prototype for each handler.  \n  \n For more information on how the `ICommandUI` interface is used in command routing, see [How to: Add Command Routing to the Windows Forms Control](../../dotnet/how-to-add-command-routing-to-the-windows-forms-control.md).  \n  \n For more information on using Windows Forms, see [Using a Windows Form User Control in MFC](../../dotnet/using-a-windows-form-user-control-in-mfc.md).  \n  \n For more information on how user interface commands are managed in MFC, see [CCmdUI Class](../../mfc/reference/ccmdui-class.md).  \n  \n##  <a name=\"icommandui__check\"></a>  ICommandUI::Check  \n Sets the user interface item for this command to the appropriate check state.  \n  \n```  \nproperty UICheckState Check;  \n```  \n  \n### Remarks  \n This property sets the user interface item for this command to the appropriate check state. Set `Check` to the following values:  \n  \n|Term|Definition|  \n|----------|----------------|  \n|0|Uncheck|  \n|1|Check|  \n|2|Set indeterminate|  \n  \n##  <a name=\"icommandui__continuerouting\"></a>  ICommandUI::ContinueRouting  \n Tells the command routing mechanism to continue routing the current message down the chain of handlers.  \n  \n```  \nvoid ContinueRouting();\n```  \n  \n### Remarks  \n This is an advanced member function that should be used in conjunction with an [ON_COMMAND_EX](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/0bb49090-aee8-4203-87c8-dd001d3dd26e) handler that returns `FALSE`.
