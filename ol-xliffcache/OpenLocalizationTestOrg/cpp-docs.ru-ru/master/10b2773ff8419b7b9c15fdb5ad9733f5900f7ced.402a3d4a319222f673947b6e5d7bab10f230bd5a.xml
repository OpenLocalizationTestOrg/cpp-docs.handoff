For an example, see the [Scribble](../visual-cpp-samples.md) sample program. You can also handle control-notification messages from other controls in your dialog box.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Dialog Boxes](../mfc/dialog-boxes.md)   \n [Life Cycle of a Dialog Box](../mfc/life-cycle-of-a-dialog-box.md)   \n [Commonly Overridden Member Functions](../mfc/commonly-overridden-member-functions.md)\n"}
