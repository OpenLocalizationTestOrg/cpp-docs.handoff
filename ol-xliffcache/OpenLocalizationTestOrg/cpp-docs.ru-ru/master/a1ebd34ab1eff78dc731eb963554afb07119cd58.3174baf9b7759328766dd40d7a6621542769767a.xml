Fix the problem and recompile  \n  \n The following sample generates C4635:  \n  \n```  \n// C4635.cpp  \n// compile with: /doc /clr /W3 /c  \n/// <summary>     \n/// The contents of the folder have changed.  \n/// <summary/>   // C4635  \n  \n// try the following line instead  \n// /// </summary>  \npublic ref class Test {};  \n```  \n  \n Notice that the output for this sample says: **End tag 'member' does not match the start tag 'summary'.**  \n  \n The problem with this sample is that the end tag for \\<summary> is poorly formed, and the compiler does not recognize it as the \\<summary> end tag.  The \\<member> tag is embedded in the .xdc file by the compiler in every /doc compilation.  So, the problem here is that the end tag \\</member>, does not match the previous start tag that the compiler processed (\\<summary>."}
