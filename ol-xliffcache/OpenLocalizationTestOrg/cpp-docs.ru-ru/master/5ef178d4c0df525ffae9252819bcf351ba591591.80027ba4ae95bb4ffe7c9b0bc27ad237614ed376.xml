This guarantees that the wide-character strings will be stored in the correct format.  \n  \n The default *locale-string* is \"\".  \n  \n The \"C\" locale maps each character in the string to its value as a `wchar_t` (unsigned short). Other values that are valid for `setlocale` are those entries that are found in the [Language Strings](../c-runtime-library/language-strings.md) list. For example, you could issue:  \n  \n```  \n#pragma setlocale(\"dutch\")  \n```  \n  \n The ability to issue a language string depends on the code page and language ID support on your computer.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Pragma Directives and the __Pragma Keyword](../preprocessor/pragma-directives-and-the-pragma-keyword.md)"}
