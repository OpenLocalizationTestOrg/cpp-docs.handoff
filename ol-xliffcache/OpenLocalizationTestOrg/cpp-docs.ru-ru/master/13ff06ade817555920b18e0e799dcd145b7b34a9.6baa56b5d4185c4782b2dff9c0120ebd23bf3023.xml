Such tasks include creating new classes, adding new member functions and variables, and adding Automation methods and properties. The code wizards are designed to let you do all these things.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  You can now add message handlers and map messages to them and override MFC virtual functions using the [Properties window](/visualstudio/ide/reference/properties-window).  \n  \n## Accessing Visual C++ Code Wizards  \n There are three locations where you can access Visual C++ code wizards:  \n  \n-   On the **Project** menu, the **Add New Item** command allows you to bring up the `Add New Item` dialog box, which helps you to add new files to your project. The **Add Class** command displays the [Add Class](../ide/add-class-dialog-box.md) dialog box, which in turn open wizards for each of the class types you can add to your project. The **Add Resource** command displays the [Add Resource](../windows/add-resource-dialog-box.md) dialog box, from which you can create or select a resource to add to your project.  \n  \n     If you highlight a class or an interface in your project in Class View, the **Project** menu also displays the following commands:  \n  \n    -   **Implement Interface** (from a control class only)  \n  \n    -   **Add Function**  \n  \n    -   **Add Variable**  \n  \n    -   **Add Connection Point** (ATL class only)  \n  \n    -   **Add Method** (from an interface only)  \n  \n    -   **Add Property** (from an interface only)  \n  \n    -   **Add Event** (from a control class only)  \n  \n-   In **Solution Explorer**, right-clicking any folder and clicking **Add** from the shortcut menu allows you to add new or existing files, more folders, items, classes, resources, and Web references to the project.  \n  \n-   From the [Class View window](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/8d7430a9-3e33-454c-a9e1-a85e3d2db925), right-clicking the appropriate node and clicking **Add** from the shortcut menu allows you to add functions, variables, classes, properties, methods, events, interfaces, connection points, or other code to your project.  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  Visual Studio does not provide a wizard to add an interface to a project. You can add an interface to an ATL project or to an [Adding ATL Support to Your MFC Project](../mfc/reference/adding-atl-support-to-your-mfc-project.md) by adding a simple object using the [ATL Simple Object Wizard](../atl/reference/atl-simple-object-wizard.md). Alternately, open the project's .idl file and create the interface by typing:  \n  \n    ```  \n    interface IMyInterface {  \n    };  \n  \n    ```  \n  \n     See [Implementing an Interface](../ide/implementing-an-interface-visual-cpp.md) and [Adding Objects and Controls to an ATL Project](../atl/reference/adding-objects-and-controls-to-an-atl-project.md) for more information.  \n  \n    |Access code wizard from|Description|  \n    |-----------------------------|-----------------|  \n    |Add New Item|The Add New Item code wizards add source files to your project.
