For example, this error occurs if the initialization expression evaluates to `void`, which is not a type.  \n  \n### To correct this error  \n  \n1.  Ensure that the type of the initialization expression is not `void`.  \n  \n2.  Ensure that the declaration is not a pointer to a fundamental type. For more information, see [Fundamental Types](../../cpp/fundamental-types-cpp.md).  \n  \n3.  Ensure that if the declaration is a pointer to a type, the initialization expression is a pointer type.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example yields C3535 because the initialization expression evaluates to `void`.  \n  \n```  \n// C3535a.cpp  \n// Compile with /Zc:auto  \nvoid f(){}  \nint main()  \n{  \n   auto x = f();   //C3535  \n   return 0;  \n}  \n```  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example yields C3535 because the statement declares variable `x` as a pointer to a deduced type, but the type of the initializer expression is double. Consequently, the compiler cannot deduce the type of the variable.  \n  \n```  \n// C3535b.cpp  \n// Compile with /Zc:auto  \nint main()  \n{  \n   auto* x = 123.0;   // C3535  \n   return 0;  \n}  \n```  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example yields C3535 because variable `p` declares a pointer to a deduced type, but the initialization expression is not a pointer type.  \n  \n```  \n// C3535c.cpp  \n// Compile with /Zc:auto  \nclass A { };  \nA x;  \nauto *p = x;  // C3535  \n```  \n  \n## See Also  \n [auto Keyword](../../cpp/auto-keyword.md)   \n [Fundamental Types](../../cpp/fundamental-types-cpp.md)"}
