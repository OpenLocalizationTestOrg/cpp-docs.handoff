Beginning with [!INCLUDE[vs_orcas_long](../../atl/reference/includes/vs_orcas_long_md.md)], ATL Server is no longer included as part of Visual Studio, but has been released as a shared-source project at CodePlex. To download the ATL Server source code and tools, go to [http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=81979](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=81979).  \n  \n-   Low system resources. Close some applications to resolve this.  \n  \n-   Insufficient security privileges. Verify that you have sufficient security privileges.  \n  \n-   The executable paths specified in [VC++ Directories](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/e027448b-c811-4c3d-8531-4325ad3f6e02) do not include the path for the tool that you are attempting to run.  \n  \n-   For makefile projects, you are missing a command to run on either **Build Command Line** or **Rebuild Command Line**.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Project Build Errors and Warnings (PRJxxxx)](../../error-messages/tool-errors/project-build-errors-and-warnings-prjxxxx.md)"}
