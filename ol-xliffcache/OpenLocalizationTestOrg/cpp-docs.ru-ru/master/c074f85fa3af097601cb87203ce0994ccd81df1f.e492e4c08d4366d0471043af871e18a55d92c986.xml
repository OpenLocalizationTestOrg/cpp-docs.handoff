Using a resource-only DLL is a good way to share the same set of resources among multiple programs. It is also a good way to provide an application with resources localized for multiple languages (see [Localized Resources in MFC Applications: Satellite DLLs](../build/localized-resources-in-mfc-applications-satellite-dlls.md)).  \n  \n To create a resource-only DLL, you create a new Win32 DLL (non-MFC) project and add your resources to the project.  \n  \n-   Select Win32 Project in the **New Project** dialog box and specify a DLL project type in the Win32 Project Wizard.  \n  \n-   Create a new resource script that contains the resources (such as a string or a menu) for the DLL and save the .rc file.  \n  \n-   On the **Project** menu, click **Add Existing Item**, and then insert the new .rc file into the project.  \n  \n-   Specify the [/NOENTRY](../build/reference/noentry-no-entry-point.md) linker option. /NOENTRY prevents the linker from linking a reference to _main into the DLL; this option is required to create a resource-only DLL.  \n  \n-   Build the DLL.  \n  \n The application that uses the resource-only DLL should call **LoadLibrary** to [explicitly link to the DLL](../build/loadlibrary-and-afxloadlibrary.md). To access the resources, call the generic functions **FindResource** and **LoadResource**, which work on any kind of resource, or call one of the following resource-specific functions:  \n  \n-   `FormatMessage`  \n  \n-   **LoadAccelerators**  \n  \n-   `LoadBitmap`  \n  \n-   `LoadCursor`  \n  \n-   `LoadIcon`  \n  \n-   `LoadMenu`  \n  \n-   `LoadString`  \n  \n The application should call **FreeLibrary** when it is finished using the resources.  \n  \n## What do you want to know more about?  \n  \n-   [DELETE_PENDING_Editing Resources](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/c29d31c7-2d94-40ca-8aa0-c7262883529c)  \n  \n## See Also  \n [DLLs in Visual C++](../build/dlls-in-visual-cpp.md)"}
