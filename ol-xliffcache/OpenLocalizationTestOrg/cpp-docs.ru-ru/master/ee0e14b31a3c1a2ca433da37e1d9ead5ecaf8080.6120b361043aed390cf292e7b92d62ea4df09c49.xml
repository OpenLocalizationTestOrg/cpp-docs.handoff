Visual C++ and MFC are optional install configurations in Visual Studio setup. To make sure that MFC is installed, choose **Custom** in setup, and under **Programming Languages**, make sure that **Visual C++** and **Microsoft Foundation Classes for C++** are selected. If you have already installed Visual Studio, you will be prompted to install Visual C++ and/or MFC when you attempt to create an MFC project.  \n  \n You need the multibyte DLLs in order to build an MFC project in Visual Studio 2015 that has the **Character Set** property set to **Use Multi-Byte Character Set** or **Not Set**.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [MFC Library Versions](../mfc/mfc-library-versions.md)\n\n"}
