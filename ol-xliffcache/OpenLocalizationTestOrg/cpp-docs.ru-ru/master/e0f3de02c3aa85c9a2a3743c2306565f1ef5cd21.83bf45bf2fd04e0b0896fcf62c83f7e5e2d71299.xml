ATL provides support for implementing property pages through the [ATL Property Page Wizard](../atl/reference/atl-property-page-wizard.md) in the [Add Class dialog box](../ide/add-class-dialog-box.md).  \n  \n To create a property page using ATL:  \n  \n-   Create or open an ATL Dynamic-link library (DLL) server project.  \n  \n-   Open the [Add Class dialog box](../ide/add-class-dialog-box.md) and select **ATL Property Page**.  \n  \n-   Make sure your property page is apartment threaded (since it has a user interface).  \n  \n-   Set the title, description (Doc String), and help file to be associated with your page.  \n  \n-   Add controls to the generated dialog resource to act as the user interface of your property page.  \n  \n-   Respond to changes in your page's user interface to perform validation, update the page site, or update the objects associated with your page. In particular, call [IPropertyPageImpl::SetDirty](../atl/reference/ipropertypageimpl-class.md#ipropertypageimpl__setdirty) when the user makes changes to the property page.  \n  \n-   Optionally override the `IPropertyPageImpl` methods using the guidelines below.  \n  \n    |IPropertyPageImpl method|Override when you want to...|Notes|  \n    |------------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------|  \n    |[SetObjects](../atl/reference/ipropertypageimpl-class.md#ipropertypageimpl__setobjects)|Perform basic sanity checks on the number of objects being passed to your page and the interfaces that they support.|Execute your own code before calling the base class implementation.
