The mode is included in the string specifying the type of access (**\"r\"**, **\"w\"**, **\"a\"**, **\"r+\"**, **\"w+\"**, **\"a+\"**).  \n  \n The translation modes are as follows:  \n  \n **t**  \n Opens in text (translated) mode. In this mode, carriage-return/linefeed (CR-LF) combinations are translated into single linefeeds (LF) on input, and LF characters are translated into CR-LF combinations on output. Also, CTRL+Z is interpreted as an end-of-file character on input. In files opened for reading or reading/writing, `fopen` checks for CTRL+Z at the end of the file and removes it, if possible. This is done because using the `fseek` and `ftell` functions to move within a file ending with CTRL+Z may cause `fseek` to behave improperly near the end of the file.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The **t** option is not part of the ANSI standard for `fopen` and `freopen`. It is a Microsoft extension and should not be used where ANSI portability is desired.  \n  \n **b**  \n Opens in binary (untranslated) mode. The above translations are suppressed.  \n  \n If **t** or **b** is not given in *mode*, the translation mode is defined by the default-mode variable [_fmode](../c-runtime-library/fmode.md). For more information about using text and binary modes, see [Text and Binary Mode File I/O](../c-runtime-library/text-and-binary-mode-file-i-o.md).  \n  \n## See Also  \n [_fdopen, _wfdopen](../c-runtime-library/reference/fdopen-wfdopen.md)   \n [fopen, _wfopen](../c-runtime-library/reference/fopen-wfopen.md)   \n [freopen, _wfreopen](../c-runtime-library/reference/freopen-wfreopen.md)   \n [_fsopen, _wfsopen](../c-runtime-library/reference/fsopen-wfsopen.md)   \n [Global Constants](../c-runtime-library/global-constants.md)"}
