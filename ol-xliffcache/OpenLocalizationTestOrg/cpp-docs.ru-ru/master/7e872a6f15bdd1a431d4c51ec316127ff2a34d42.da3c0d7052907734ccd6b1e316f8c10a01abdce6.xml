clears the floating-point status word.  \n  \n## Syntax  \n  \n```  \nunsigned int _clear87( void );  \nunsigned int _clearfp( void );  \n```  \n  \n## Return Value  \n The bits in the value returned indicate the floating-point status before the call to `_clear87` or `_clearfp`. For a complete definition of the bits returned by `_clear87`, see Float.h. Many of the math library functions modify the 8087/80287 status word, with unpredictable results. Return values from `_clear87` and `_status87` become more reliable as fewer floating-point operations are performed between known states of the floating-point status word.  \n  \n## Remarks  \n The `_clear87` function clears the exception flags in the floating-point status word, sets the busy bit to 0, and returns the status word. The floating-point status word is a combination of the 8087/80287 status word and other conditions detected by the 8087/80287 exception handler, such as floating-point stack overflow and underflow.  \n  \n `_clearfp` is a platform-independent, portable version of the `_clear87` routine. It is identical to `_clear87` on Intel (x86) platforms and is also supported by the x64 and ARM platforms. To ensure that your floating-point code is portable to x64 and ARM, use `_clearfp`. If you are only targeting x86 platforms, you can use either `_clear87` or `_clearfp`.  \n  \n These functions are deprecated when compiling with [/clr (Common Language Runtime Compilation)](../../build/reference/clr-common-language-runtime-compilation.md) or `/clr:pure` because the common language runtime only supports the default floating-point precision.  \n  \n## Requirements  \n  \n|Routine|Required header|  \n|-------------|---------------------|  \n|`_clear87`|\\<float.h>|  \n|`_clearfp`|\\<float.h>|  \n  \n For more compatibility information, see [Compatibility](../../c-runtime-library/compatibility.md) in the Introduction.  \n  \n## Example  \n  \n```  \n// crt_clear87.c  \n// compile with: /Od  \n  \n// This program creates various floating-point   \n// problems, then uses _clear87 to report on these problems.  \n// Compile this program with Optimizations disabled (/Od).   \n// Otherwise the optimizer will remove the code associated with   \n// the unused floating-point values.  \n//  \n  \n#include <stdio.h>  \n#include <float.h>  \n  \nint main( void )  \n{  \n   double a = 1e-40, b;  \n   float x, y;  \n  \n   printf( \"Status: %.4x - clear\\n\", _clear87()  );  \n  \n   // Store into y is inexact and underflows:  \n   y = a;  \n   printf( \"Status: %.4x - inexact, underflow\\n\", _clear87() );  \n  \n   // y is denormal:   \n   b = y;  \n   printf( \"Status: %.4x - denormal\\n\", _clear87() );  \n}  \n```  \n  \n```Output  \nStatus: 0000 - clear  \nStatus: 0003 - inexact, underflow  \nStatus: 80000 - denormal  \n```  \n  \n## .NET Framework Equivalent  \n Not applicable.
