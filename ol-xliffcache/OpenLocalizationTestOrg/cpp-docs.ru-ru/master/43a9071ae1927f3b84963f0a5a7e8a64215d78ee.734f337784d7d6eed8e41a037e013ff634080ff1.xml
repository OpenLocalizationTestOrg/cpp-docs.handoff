Any macros are expanded before the command is executed. NMAKE replaces the command specification with the command's exit code, which can be used in an expression to control preprocessing.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Expressions in Makefile Preprocessing](../build/expressions-in-makefile-preprocessing.md)"}
