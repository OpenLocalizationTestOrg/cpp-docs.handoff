A control ID for that radio button then appears in the [Add Member Variable Wizard](../ide/add-member-variable-wizard.md), allowing you to add a member variable for the group of radio buttons.  \n  \n You can have more than one group of radio buttons on a dialog box, and each group should be added using the following procedure.  \n  \n### To add a group of radio buttons to a dialog box  \n  \n1.  Select the radio button control in the [Toolbox Window](/visualstudio/ide/reference/toolbox) and click the location in the dialog box where you want to place the control.  \n  \n2.  Repeat Step 1 to add as many radio buttons as you need. Make sure that the radio buttons in the group are consecutive in the tab order (for more information, see [Changing the Tab Order of Controls](../mfc/changing-the-tab-order-of-controls.md)).  \n  \n3.  In the [Properties Window](/visualstudio/ide/reference/properties-window), set the **Group** property of the *first* radio button in the tab order to **True**.  \n  \n     Changing the **Group** property to **True** adds the WS_GROUP style to the button's entry in the dialog object of the resource script and ensures that a user can only select one radio button at a time in the button group (when the user clicks one radio button, the others in the group are cleared).  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  Only the first radio button in the group should have the **Group** property set to **True**. If you have additional controls that are not part of the button group, set the **Group** property of the first control *that is outside the group* to **True** as well. You can quickly identify the first control outside of the group by pressing CTRL+D to view the tab order.  \n  \n### To add a member variable for the radio button group  \n  \n1.  Right-click the first radio button control in the tab order (the dominant control and the one with the **Group** property set to True).  \n  \n2.  Choose **Add Variable** from the shortcut menu.  \n  \n3.  In the [Add Member Variable wizard](../ide/add-member-variable-wizard.md), select the **Control variable** check box, then select the **Value** radio button.  \n  \n4.  In the **Variable name** box, type a name for the new member variable.  \n  \n5.  In the **Variable type** list box, select **int** or type **int**.  \n  \n6.  You can now modify your code to specify which radio button should appear selected. For example, m_radioBox1 = 0; selects the first radio button in the group.  \n  \n For information on adding resources to managed projects, please see [Resources in Applications](http://msdn.microsoft.com/Library/8ad495d4-2941-40cf-bf64-e82e85825890) in the *.NET Framework Developer's Guide.* For information on manually adding resource files to managed projects, accessing resources, displaying static resources, and assigning resources strings to properties, see [Walkthrough: Localizing Windows Forms](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/9a96220d-a19b-4de0-9f48-01e5d82679e5) and [Walkthrough: Using Resources for Localization with ASP.NET](http://msdn.microsoft.com/Library/bb4e5b44-e2b0-48ab-bbe9-609fb33900b6).  \n  \n Requirements  \n  \n Win32  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Arrangement of Controls on Dialog Boxes](../mfc/arrangement-of-controls-on-dialog-boxes.md)   \n [Controls in Dialog Boxes](../mfc/controls-in-dialog-boxes.md)   \n [Controls](../mfc/controls-mfc.md)\n\n"}
