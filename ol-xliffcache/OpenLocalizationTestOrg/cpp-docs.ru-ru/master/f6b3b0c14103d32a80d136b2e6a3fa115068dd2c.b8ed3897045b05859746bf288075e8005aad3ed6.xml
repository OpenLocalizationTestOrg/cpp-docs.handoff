`recursive_timed_mutex`; the templates `lock_guard` and `unique_lock`; and supporting types and functions that define mutual-exclusion code regions.  \n  \n> [!WARNING]\n>  The STL synchronization types in Visual Studio 2015 are based on Windows synchronization primitives and no longer use ConcRT (except when the target platform is Windows XP). The types defined in \\<mutex> should not be used with any ConcRT types or functions.  \n  \n## Syntax  \n  \n```cpp  \n#include <mutex>  \n```  \n  \n## Remarks  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  In code that is compiled by using **/clr** or **/clr:pure**, this header is blocked.  \n  \n The classes `mutex` and `recursive_mutex` are *mutex types*. A mutex type has a default constructor and a destructor that does not throw exceptions. These objects have methods that provide mutual exclusion when multiple threads try to lock the same object. Specifically, a mutex type contains the methods `lock`, `try_lock`, and `unlock`:  \n  \n-   The `lock` method blocks the calling thread until the thread obtains ownership of the mutex. Its return value is ignored.  \n  \n-   The `try_lock` method tries to obtain ownership of the mutex without blocking. Its return type is convertible to `bool` and is `true` if the method obtains ownership, but is otherwise `false`.  \n  \n-   The `unlock` method releases the ownership of the mutex from the calling thread.  \n  \n You can use mutex types as type arguments to instantiate the templates `lock_guard` and `unique_lock`. You can use objects of these types as the `Lock` argument to the wait member functions in the template [condition_variable_any](../standard-library/condition-variable-any-class.md).  \n  \n A *timed mutex type* satisfies the requirements for a mutex type. In addition, it has the `try_lock_for` and `try_lock_until` methods that must be callable by using one argument and must return a type that is convertible to `bool`. A timed mutex type can define these functions by using additional arguments, provided that those additional arguments all have default values.  \n  \n-   The `try_lock_for` method must be callable by using one argument, `Rel_time`, whose type is an instantiation of [chrono::duration](../standard-library/duration-class.md). The method tries to obtain ownership of the mutex, but returns within the time that is designated by `Rel_time`, regardless of success. The return value converts to `true` if the method obtains ownership; otherwise, the return value converts to `false`.  \n  \n-   The `try_lock_until` method must be callable by using one argument, `Abs_time`, whose type is an instantiation of [chrono::time_point](../standard-library/time-point-class.md). The method tries to obtain ownership of the mutex, but returns no later than the time that is designated by `Abs_time`, regardless of success. The return value converts to `true` if the method obtains ownership; otherwise, the return value converts to `false`.  \n  \n A mutex type is also known as a *lockable type*. If it does not provide the member function `try_lock`, it is a *basic lockable type*. A timed mutex type is also known as a *timed lockable type*.  \n  \n### Classes  \n  \n|Name|Description|  \n|----------|-----------------|  \n|[lock_guard Class](../standard-library/lock-guard-class.md)|Represents a template that can be instantiated to create an object whose destructor unlocks a `mutex`.|  \n|[mutex Class (STL)](../standard-library/mutex-class-stl.md)|Represents a mutex type.
