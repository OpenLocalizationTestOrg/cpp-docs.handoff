The compiler can generate default constructors and destructors (called special member functions) if none are declared in the class. However, if you define one of these functions without a matching declaration in the class, the compiler detects a conflict.  \n  \n To fix this error, in the class declaration, declare each member function that you define outside the class declaration.  \n  \n The following sample generates C2600:  \n  \n```  \n// C2600.cpp  \n// compile with: /c  \nclass C {};  \nC::~C() {}   // C2600  \n  \nclass D {  \n   D::~D();  \n};  \n  \nD::~D() {}  \n```"}
