The classes form a derivation hierarchy all derived from class [exception](../standard-library/exception-class.md) and include two general types of exceptions: logical errors and run-time errors. The logical errors are caused programmer mistakes. They derive from the base class logic_error and include:  \n  \n-   `domain_error`  \n  \n-   `invalid_argument`  \n  \n-   `length_error`  \n  \n-   `out_of_range`  \n  \n The run-time errors occur because of mistakes in either the library functions or in the run-time system. They derive from the base class runtime_error and include:  \n  \n-   `overflow_error`  \n  \n-   `range_error`  \n  \n-   `underflow_error`  \n  \n### Classes  \n  \n|||  \n|-|-|  \n|[domain_error Class](../standard-library/domain-error-class.md)|The class serves as the base class for all exceptions thrown to report a domain error.|  \n|[invalid_argument Class](../standard-library/invalid-argument-class.md)|The class serves as the base class for all exceptions thrown to report an invalid argument.|  \n|[length_error Class](../standard-library/length-error-class.md)|The class serves as the base class for all exceptions thrown to report an attempt to generate an object too long to be specified.|  \n|[logic_error Class](../standard-library/logic-error-class.md)|The class serves as the base class for all exceptions thrown to report errors presumably detectable before the program executes, such as violations of logical preconditions.|  \n|[out_of_range Class](../standard-library/out-of-range-class.md)|The class serves as the base class for all exceptions thrown to report an argument that is out of its valid range.|  \n|[overflow_error Class](../standard-library/overflow-error-class.md)|The class serves as the base class for all exceptions thrown to report an arithmetic overflow.|  \n|[range_error Class](../standard-library/range-error-class.md)|The class serves as the base class for all exceptions thrown to report a range error.|  \n|[runtime_error Class](../standard-library/runtime-error-class.md)|The class serves as the base class for all exceptions thrown to report errors presumably detectable only when the program executes.|  \n|[underflow_error Class](../standard-library/underflow-error-class.md)|The class serves as the base class for all exceptions thrown to report an arithmetic underflow.|  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Header Files Reference](../standard-library/cpp-standard-library-header-files.md)   \n [Thread Safety in the C++ Standard Library](../standard-library/thread-safety-in-the-cpp-standard-library.md)\n\n"}
