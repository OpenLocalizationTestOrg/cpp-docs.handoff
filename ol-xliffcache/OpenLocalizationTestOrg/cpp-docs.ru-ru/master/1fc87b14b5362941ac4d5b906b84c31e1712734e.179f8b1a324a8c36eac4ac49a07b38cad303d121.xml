Notifications\nWhen you specify the `TBSTYLE_TOOLTIPS` style, the toolbar creates and manages a tool tip control. A tool tip is a small pop-up window that contains a line of text describing a toolbar button. The tool tip is hidden, appearing only when the user puts the cursor on a toolbar button and leaves it there for approximately one-half second. The tool tip is displayed near the cursor.  \n  \n Before the tool tip is displayed, the **TTN_NEEDTEXT** notification message is sent to the toolbar's owner window to retrieve the descriptive text for the button. If the toolbar's owner window is a `CFrameWnd` window, tool tips are displayed without any extra effort, because `CFrameWnd` has a default handler for the **TTN_NEEDTEXT** notification. If the toolbar's owner window is not derived from `CFrameWnd`, such as a dialog box or form view, you must add an entry to your owner window's message map and provide a notification handler in the message map. The entry to your owner window's message map is as follows:  \n  \n [!code-cpp[NVC_MFCControlLadenDialog#40](../mfc/codesnippet/cpp/handling-tool-tip-notifications_1.cpp)]  \n  \n## Remarks  \n `memberFxn`  \n The member function to be called when text is needed for this button.  \n  \n Note that the id of a tool tip is always 0.  \n  \n In addition to the **TTN_NEEDTEXT** notification, a tool tip control can send the following notifications to a toolbar control:  \n  \n|Notification|Meaning|  \n|------------------|-------------|  \n|**TTN_NEEDTEXTA**|Tool tip control requires ASCII text (Windows 95 only)|  \n|**TTN_NEEDTEXTW**|Tool tip control requires UNICODE text (Windows NT only)|  \n|**TBN_HOTITEMCHANGE**|Indicates that the hot (highlighted) item has changed.|  \n|**NM_RCLICK**|Indicates the user has right-clicked a button.|  \n|**TBN_DRAGOUT**|Indicates the user has clicked the button and dragged the pointer off the button. It allows an application to implement drag and drop from a toolbar button.
