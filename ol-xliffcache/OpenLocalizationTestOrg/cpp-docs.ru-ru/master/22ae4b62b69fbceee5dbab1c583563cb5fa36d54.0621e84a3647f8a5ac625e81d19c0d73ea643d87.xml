To fully take advantage of ATL, a working familiarity with COM is highly recommended.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [ATL Class Overview](../atl/atl-class-overview.md)  \n Provides links to and brief descriptions of the ATL classes organized by category.  \n  \n [ATL Classes](../atl/reference/atl-classes.md)  \n Provides reference material on the classes organized alphabetically.  \n  \n [ATL Functions](../atl/reference/atl-functions.md)  \n Provides reference material on the global functions organized alphabetically. Includes topics organizing the functions into categories.  \n  \n [ATL Global Variables](../atl/reference/atl-global-variables.md)  \n Provides reference material on the global variables organized alphabetically.  \n  \n [ATL Macros](../atl/reference/atl-macros.md)  \n Provides reference material on the macros organized alphabetically. Includes topics organizing the macros into categories.  \n  \n [ATL Structures](../atl/reference/atl-structures.md)  \n Provides reference material on the structures organized alphabetically.  \n  \n [ATL Typedefs](../atl/reference/atl-typedefs.md)  \n Provides reference material on the typedefs organized alphabetically  \n  \n [Archetypes](../atl/reference/atl-archetypes.md)  \n Provides links to the ATL archetypes, which are theoretical classes that supply a collection of methods, data members, static functions, typedefs, or other features, listed alphabetically.  \n  \n [Obsolete ATL Topics](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/7af0223d-148e-4a4c-bf9c-3e916a3b67ec)  \n Provides reference material on the classes, macros, and functions that are obsolete or deprecated.  \n  \n## Related Sections  \n [ATL](../atl/active-template-library-atl-concepts.md)  \n Provides topics on how to program using the Active Template Library (ATL).  \n  \n [ATL Tutorial](../atl/active-template-library-atl-tutorial.md)  \n Leads you through the creation of a control and demonstrates some ATL fundamentals in the process.  \n  \n [ATL Samples](../visual-cpp-samples.md)  \n Sample code that shows how to use ATL to write COM objects.  \n  \n [OLE DB Templates](../data/oledb/ole-db-templates.md)  \n Provides reference material for the OLE DB consumer and provider templates, a set of template classes that implement many commonly used OLE DB interfaces.  \n  \n [Visual C++ Libraries](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/fec23c40-10c0-4857-9cdc-33a3b99b30ae)  \n Provides links to the various libraries provided with Visual C++, including ATL, MFC, OLE DB Templates, the C run-time library, and the Standard C++ Library.\n\n"}
