        <trans-unit id="103" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>One of the advantages of the exception mechanism is that execution, together with data about the exception, jumps directly from the statement that throws the exception to the first catch statement that handles it.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="104" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>The handler may be any number of levels up in the call stack.</source>

        <trans-unit id="105" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Functions that are called between the try statement and the throw statement are not required to know anything about the exception that is thrown.</source>

          <source>However, they have to be designed so that they can go out of scope "unexpectedly" at any point where an exception might propagate up from below, and do so without leaving behind partially created objects, leaked memory, or data structures that are in unusable states.</source>

          <source>A robust exception-handling policy requires careful thought and should be part of the design process.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="109" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>In general, most exceptions are detected and thrown at the lower layers of a software module, but typically these layers do not have enough context to handle the error or expose a message to end users.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="110" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>In the middle layers, functions can catch and rethrow an exception when they have to inspect the exception object, or they have additional useful information to provide for the upper layer that ultimately catches the exception.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="111" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>A function should catch and "swallow" an exception only if it is able to completely recover from it.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="112" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>In many cases, the correct behavior in the middle layers is to let an exception propagate up the call stack.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="113" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Even at the highest layer, it might be appropriate to let an unhandled exception terminate a program if the exception leaves the program in a state in which its correctness cannot be guaranteed.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="114" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>No matter how a function handles an exception, to help guarantee that it is "exception-safe," it must be designed according to the following basic rules.</source>

          <source>Keep Resource Classes Simple</source>

        <trans-unit id="116" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>When you encapsulate manual resource management in classes, use a class that does nothing else to manage each resource; otherwise, you might introduce leaks.</source>

          <source>Use <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>smart pointers<ept id="p1">](../cpp/smart-pointers-modern-cpp.md)</ept> when possible, as shown in the following example.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="118" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>This example is intentionally artificial and simplistic to highlight the differences when <ph id="ph1">`shared_ptr`</ph> is used.</source>

        <trans-unit id="119" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Use the RAII Idiom to Manage Resources</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="120" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>To be exception-safe, a function must ensure that objects that it has allocated by using <ph id="ph1">`malloc`</ph> or <ph id="ph2">`new`</ph> are destroyed, and all resources such as file handles are closed or released even if an exception is thrown.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="121" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>The <bpt id="p1">*</bpt>Resource Acquisition Is Initialization<ept id="p1">*</ept> (RAII) idiom ties management of such resources to the lifespan of automatic variables.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="122" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>When a function goes out of scope, either by returning normally or because of an exception, the destructors for all fully-constructed automatic variables are invoked.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="123" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>An RAII wrapper object such as a smart pointer calls the appropriate delete or close function in its destructor.</source>

        <trans-unit id="124" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>In exception-safe code, it is critically important to pass ownership of each resource immediately to some kind of RAII object.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="125" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Note that the <ph id="ph1">`vector`</ph>, <ph id="ph2">`string`</ph>, <ph id="ph3">`make_shared`</ph>, <ph id="ph4">`fstream`</ph>, and similar classes handle acquisition of the resource for you.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="126" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>However, <ph id="ph1">`unique_ptr`</ph> and traditional <ph id="ph2">`shared_ptr`</ph> constructions are special because resource acquisition is performed by the user instead of the object; therefore, they count as <bpt id="p1">*</bpt>Resource Release Is Destruction<ept id="p1">*</ept> but are questionable as RAII.</source>

          <source>The Three Exception Guarantees</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="128" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Typically, exception safety is discussed in terms of the three exception guarantees that a function can provide: the <bpt id="p1">*</bpt>no-fail guarantee<ept id="p1">*</ept>, the <bpt id="p2">*</bpt>strong guarantee<ept id="p2">*</ept>, and the <bpt id="p3">*</bpt>basic guarantee<ept id="p3">*</ept>.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="129" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>No-fail Guarantee</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="130" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>The no-fail (or, "no-throw") guarantee is the strongest guarantee that a function can provide.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="131" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>It states that the function will not throw an exception or allow one to propagate.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="132" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>However, you cannot reliably provide such a guarantee unless (a) you know that all the functions that this function calls are also no-fail, or (b) you know that any exceptions that are thrown are caught before they reach this function, or (c) you know how to catch and correctly handle all exceptions that might reach this function.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="133" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Both the strong guarantee and the basic guarantee rely on the assumption that the destructors are no-fail.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="134" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>All containers and types in the Standard Library guarantee that their destructors do not throw.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="135" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>There is also a converse requirement: The Standard Library requires that user-defined types that are given to it—for example, as template arguments—must have non-throwing destructors.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="136" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Strong Guarantee</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="137" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>The strong guarantee states that if a function goes out of scope because of an exception, it will not leak memory and program state will not be modified.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="138" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>A function that provides a strong guarantee is essentially a transaction that has commit or rollback semantics: either it completely succeeds or it has no effect.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="139" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Basic Guarantee</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="140" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>The basic guarantee is the weakest of the three.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="141" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>However, it might be the best choice when a strong guarantee is too expensive in memory consumption or in performance.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="142" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>The basic guarantee states that if an exception occurs, no memory is leaked and the object is still in a usable state even though the data might have been modified.</source>

          <source>Although automatic variables that are initialized prior to the exception will have their destructors invoked, dynamically allocated memory or resources that are not managed by a smart pointer or similar automatic variable will be leaked.</source>
