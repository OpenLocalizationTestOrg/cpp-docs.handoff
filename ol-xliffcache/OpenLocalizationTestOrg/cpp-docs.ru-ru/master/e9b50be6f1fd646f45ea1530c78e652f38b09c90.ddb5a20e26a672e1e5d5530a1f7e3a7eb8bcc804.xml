Check for one of these causes:  \n  \n-   A format string for a `printf_s` or `scanf_s` function contained a floating-point format specification and the program did not contain any floating-point values or variables. To fix this issue, use a floating-point argument to correspond to the floating-point format specification, or perform a floating-point assignment elsewhere in the program. This causes floating-point support to be loaded.  \n  \n-   The compiler minimizes a program's size by loading floating-point support only when necessary. The compiler cannot detect floating-point operations or floating-point format specifications in format strings, so it does not load the necessary floating-point routines. To fix this issue, use a floating-point format specification and supply a floating-point argument, or perform a floating-point assignment elsewhere in the program. This causes floating-point support to be loaded.  \n  \n-   In a mixed-language program, a C library was specified before a FORTRAN library when the program was linked. Relink and specify the C library last."}
