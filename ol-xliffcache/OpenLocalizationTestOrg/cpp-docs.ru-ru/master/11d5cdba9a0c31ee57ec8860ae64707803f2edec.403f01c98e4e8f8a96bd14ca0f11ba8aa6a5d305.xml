Without this style, the scroll bar is hidden when the list box does not contain enough items.  \n  \n-   **LBS_EXTENDEDSEL** The user can select multiple items using the SHIFT key and the mouse or special key combinations.  \n  \n-   **LBS_HASSTRINGS** Specifies an owner-draw list box that contains items consisting of strings. The list box maintains the memory and pointers for the strings so the application can use the `GetText` member function to retrieve the text for a particular item.  \n  \n-   **LBS_MULTICOLUMN** Specifies a multicolumn list box that is scrolled horizontally. The `SetColumnWidth` member function sets the width of the columns.  \n  \n-   **LBS_MULTIPLESEL** String selection is toggled each time the user clicks or double-clicks the string. Any number of strings can be selected.  \n  \n-   **LBS_NODATA** Specifies a no-data list box. Specify this style when the count of items in the list box will exceed one thousand. A no-data list box must also have the **LBS_OWNERDRAWFIXED** style, but must not have the **LBS_SORT** or **LBS_HASSTRINGS** style.  \n  \n     A no-data list box resembles an owner-drawn list box except that it contains no string or bitmap data for an item. Commands to add, insert, or delete an item always ignore any given item data; requests to find a string within the list box always fail. The system sends the `WM_DRAWITEM` message to the owner window when an item must be drawn. The itemID member of the `DRAWITEMSTRUCT` structure passed with the `WM_DRAWITEM` message specifies the line number of the item to be drawn. A no-data list box does not send a `WM_DELETEITEM` message.  \n  \n-   **LBS_NOINTEGRALHEIGHT** The size of the list box is exactly the size specified by the application when it created the list box. Usually, Windows sizes a list box so that the list box does not display partial items.  \n  \n-   **LBS_NOREDRAW** List-box display is not updated when changes are made. This style can be changed at any time by sending a **WM_SETREDRAW** message.  \n  \n-   **LBS_NOSEL** Specifies that the list box contains items that can be viewed but not selected.  \n  \n-   **LBS_NOTIFY** Parent window receives an input message whenever the user clicks or double-clicks a string.  \n  \n-   **LBS_OWNERDRAWFIXED** The owner of the list box is responsible for drawing its contents; the items in the list box are the same height.  \n  \n-   **LBS_OWNERDRAWVARIABLE** The owner of the list box is responsible for drawing its contents; the items in the list box are variable in height.  \n  \n-   **LBS_SORT** Strings in the list box are sorted alphabetically.  \n  \n-   **LBS_STANDARD** Strings in the list box are sorted alphabetically, and the parent window receives an input message whenever the user clicks or double-clicks a string. The list box contains borders on all sides.  \n  \n-   **LBS_USETABSTOPS** Allows a list box to recognize and expand tab characters when drawing its strings. The default tab positions are 32 dialog units. (A dialog unit is a horizontal or vertical distance. One horizontal dialog unit is equal to one-fourth of the current dialog base width unit. The dialog base units are computed based on the height and width of the current system font. The **GetDialogBaseUnits** Windows function returns the current dialog base units in pixels.) This style should not be used with **LBS_OWNERDRAWFIXED**.  \n  \n-   **LBS_WANTKEYBOARDINPUT** The owner of the list box receives `WM_VKEYTOITEM` or `WM_CHARTOITEM` messages whenever the user presses a key while the list box has input focus. This allows an application to perform special processing on the keyboard input.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Styles Used by MFC](../../mfc/reference/styles-used-by-mfc.md)   \n [CListBox::Create](../../mfc/reference/clistbox-class.md#clistbox__create)   \n [List Box Styles](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb775149)\n\n"}
