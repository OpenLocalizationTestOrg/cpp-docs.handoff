You cannot specify a .pgc file when **/clear** is specified.  \n  \n **/detail**—Displays detailed statistics, including flow graph coverage information.  \n  \n **/summary**—Displays per-function statistics.  \n  \n **/unique**—when used with **/summary**, causes decorated function names to display.  The default, when /unique is not used, is for undecorated function names to be displayed.  \n  \n **/merge**[**:***n*]**—**Causes the data in the .pgc file or files to be added to the .pgd file.  The optional parameter, *n*, lets you specify hat the data should be added *n* times.  For example, if a scenario would commonly be done 6 times, you can do it once in a test run and add it to the .pgd file six times with **pgomgr /merge:6**.  \n  \n `pgcfiles`  \n One or more .pgc files whose profile data you want to merge into the .pgd file. You can specify a single .pgc file or multiple .pgc files. If you do not specify any .pgc files, pgomgr will merge all .pgc files whose filenames are the same as the .pgd file.  \n  \n `pgdfile`  \n The .pgd file into which you are merging data from the .pgc file or files.  \n  \n## Remarks  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  You can start this tool only from the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../assembler/masm/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] command prompt. You cannot start it from a system command prompt or from File Explorer.  \n  \n## Example  \n In the following example, the .pgd file was cleared of profile data.  \n  \n```  \npgomgr /clear myapp.pgd  \n```  \n  \n In the following example, the profile data in myapp1.pgc was added to the .pgd file 3 times.  \n  \n```  \npgomgr /merge:3 myapp1.pgc myapp.pgd  \n```  \n  \n In the following example, profile data from all myapp#.pgc files is added to the myapp.pgd file.  \n  \n```  \npgomgr -merge myapp1.pgd  \n```  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Tools for Manual Profile-Guided Optimization](../../build/reference/tools-for-manual-profile-guided-optimization.md)"}
