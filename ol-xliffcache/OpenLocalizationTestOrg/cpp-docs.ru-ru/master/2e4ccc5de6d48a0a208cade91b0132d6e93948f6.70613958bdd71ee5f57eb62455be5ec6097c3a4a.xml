_wcstombs_s_l\nConverts a sequence of wide characters to a corresponding sequence of multibyte characters. A version of [wcstombs, _wcstombs_l](../../c-runtime-library/reference/wcstombs-wcstombs-l.md) with security enhancements as described in [Security Features in the CRT](../../c-runtime-library/security-features-in-the-crt.md).  \n  \n## Syntax  \n  \n```  \nerrno_t wcstombs_s(  \n   size_t *pReturnValue,  \n   char *mbstr,  \n   size_t sizeInBytes,  \n   const wchar_t *wcstr,  \n   size_t count   \n);  \nerrno_t _wcstombs_s_l(  \n   size_t *pReturnValue,  \n   char *mbstr,  \n   size_t sizeInBytes,  \n   const wchar_t *wcstr,  \n   size_t count,  \n   _locale_t locale  \n);  \ntemplate <size_t size>  \nerrno_t wcstombs_s(  \n   size_t *pReturnValue,  \n   char (&mbstr)[size],  \n   const wchar_t *wcstr,  \n   size_t count   \n); // C++ only  \ntemplate <size_t size>  \nerrno_t _wcstombs_s_l(  \n   size_t *pReturnValue,  \n   char (&mbstr)[size],  \n   const wchar_t *wcstr,  \n   size_t count,  \n   _locale_t locale  \n); // C++ only  \n```  \n  \n#### Parameters  \n [out] `pReturnValue`  \n The number of characters converted.  \n  \n [out] `mbstr`  \n The address of a buffer for the resulting converted multibyte character string.  \n  \n [in]`sizeInBytes`  \n The size in bytes of the `mbstr` buffer.  \n  \n [in] `wcstr`  \n Points to the wide character string to be converted.  \n  \n [in] `count`  \n The maximum number of bytes to store in the `mbstr` buffer, not including the terminating null character, or [_TRUNCATE](../../c-runtime-library/truncate.md).  \n  \n [in] `locale`  \n The locale to use.  \n  \n## Return Value  \n Zero if successful, an error code on failure.  \n  \n|Error condition|Return value and `errno`|  \n|---------------------|------------------------------|  \n|`mbstr` is `NULL` and `sizeInBytes` > 0|`EINVAL`|  \n|`wcstr` is `NULL`|`EINVAL`|  \n|The destination buffer is too small to contain the converted string (unless `count` is `_TRUNCATE`; see Remarks below)|`ERANGE`|  \n  \n If any of these conditions occurs, the invalid parameter exception is invoked as described in [Parameter Validation](../../c-runtime-library/parameter-validation.md) . If execution is allowed to continue, the function returns an error code and sets `errno` as indicated in the table.  \n  \n## Remarks  \n The `wcstombs_s` function converts a string of wide characters pointed to by `wcstr` into multibyte characters stored in the buffer pointed to by `mbstr`. The conversion will continue for each character until one of these conditions is met:  \n  \n-   A null wide character is encountered  \n  \n-   A wide character that cannot be converted is encountered  \n  \n-   The number of bytes stored in the `mbstr` buffer equals `count`.  \n  \n The destination string is always null-terminated (even in the case of an error).  \n  \n If `count` is the special value [_TRUNCATE](../../c-runtime-library/truncate.md), then `wcstombs_s` converts as much of the string as will fit into the destination buffer, while still leaving room for a null terminator.  \n  \n If `wcstombs_s` successfully converts the source string, it puts the size in bytes of the converted string, including the null terminator, into `*``pReturnValue` (provided `pReturnValue` is not `NULL`). This occurs even if the `mbstr` argument is `NULL` and provides a way to determine the required buffer size. Note that if `mbstr` is `NULL`, `count` is ignored.  \n  \n If `wcstombs_s` encounters a wide character it cannot convert to a multibyte character, it puts 0 in `*``pReturnValue`, sets the destination buffer to an empty string, sets `errno` to `EILSEQ`, and returns `EILSEQ`.  \n  \n If the sequences pointed to by `wcstr` and `mbstr` overlap, the behavior of `wcstombs_s` is undefined.  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  Ensure that `wcstr` and `mbstr` do not overlap, and that `count` correctly reflects the number of wide characters to convert.  \n  \n `wcstombs_s` uses the current locale for any locale-dependent behavior; `_wcstombs_s_l` is identical to `wcstombs` except that it uses the locale passed in instead. For more information, see [Locale](../../c-runtime-library/locale.md).  \n  \n In C++, using these functions is simplified by template overloads; the overloads can infer buffer length automatically (eliminating the need to specify a size argument) and they can automatically replace older, non-secure functions with their newer, secure counterparts.
