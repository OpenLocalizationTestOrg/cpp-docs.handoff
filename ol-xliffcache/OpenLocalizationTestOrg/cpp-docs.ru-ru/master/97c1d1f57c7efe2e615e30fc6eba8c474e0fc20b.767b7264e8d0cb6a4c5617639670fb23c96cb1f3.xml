Can be one of the following exception types:  \n  \n|Exception types|Description|  \n|---------------------|-----------------|  \n|ConversionError|Occurs whenever there is an attempt to convert an object into something to which it cannot be converted.|  \n|RangeError|Occurs when a function is supplied with an argument that has exceeded its allowable range. For example, this error occurs if you attempt to construct an `Array` object with a length that is not a valid positive integer.|  \n|ReferenceError|Occurs when an invalid reference has been detected. This error will occur, for example, if an expected reference is null.|  \n|RegExpError|Occurs when a compilation error occurs with a regular expression. Once the regular expression is compiled, this error cannot occur. This example will occur, for example, when a regular expression is declared with a pattern that has an invalid syntax, or flags other than *i*, *g*, or *m*, or if it contains the same flag more than once.|  \n|SyntaxError|Occurs when source text is parsed and that source text does not follow correct syntax. This error will occur, for example, if the `eval` function is called with an argument that is not valid program text.|  \n|TypeError|Occurs whenever the actual type of an operand does not match the expected type. An example of when this error occurs is a function call made on something that is not an object or does not support the call.|  \n|URIError|Occurs when an illegal Uniform Resource Indicator (URI) is detected. For example, this is error occurs when an illegal character is found in a string being encoded or decoded.|  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Customizing C++ Wizards with Common JScript Functions](../ide/customizing-cpp-wizards-with-common-jscript-functions.md)   \n [JScript Functions for C++ Wizards](../ide/jscript-functions-for-cpp-wizards.md)   \n [Creating a Custom Wizard](../ide/creating-a-custom-wizard.md)   \n [Designing a Wizard](../ide/designing-a-wizard.md)"}
