The compiler identifies the `<<` operator as ambiguous. The only primitive C++ types that `CArchive` can serialize are the fixed-size types `BYTE`, `WORD`, `DWORD`, and `LONG`. All integer types must be cast to one of these types for serialization. Floating-point types must be archived using the `CArchive::Write()` member function.  \n  \n The following example shows how to archive a floating-point variable (`f`) to archive `ar`:  \n  \n```  \nar.Write(&f, sizeof( float ));  \n```"}
