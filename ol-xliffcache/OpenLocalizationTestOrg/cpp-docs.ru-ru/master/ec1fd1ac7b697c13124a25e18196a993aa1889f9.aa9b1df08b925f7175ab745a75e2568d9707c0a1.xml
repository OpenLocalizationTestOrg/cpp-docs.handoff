After you [create a drawing object](../mfc/one-stage-and-two-stage-construction-of-objects.md), you must select it into the device context in place of the default object stored there:  \n  \n [!code-cpp[NVC_MFCDocViewSDI#7](../mfc/codesnippet/cpp/selecting-a-graphic-object-into-a-device-context_1.cpp)]  \n  \n## Lifetime of Graphic Objects  \n The graphic object returned by [SelectObject](../mfc/reference/cdc-class.md#cdc__selectobject) is \"temporary.\" That is, it will be deleted by the [OnIdle](../mfc/reference/cwinapp-class.md#cwinapp__onidle) member function of class `CWinApp` the next time the program gets idle time. As long as you use the object returned by `SelectObject` in a single function without returning control to the main message loop, you will have no problem.  \n  \n### What do you want to know more about  \n  \n-   [Graphic objects](../mfc/graphic-objects.md)  \n  \n-   [One-stage and two-stage construction of graphic objects](../mfc/one-stage-and-two-stage-construction-of-objects.md)  \n  \n-   [Device contexts](../mfc/device-contexts.md)  \n  \n-   [Drawing in a View](../mfc/drawing-in-a-view.md)  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Graphic Objects](../mfc/graphic-objects.md)\n\n"}
