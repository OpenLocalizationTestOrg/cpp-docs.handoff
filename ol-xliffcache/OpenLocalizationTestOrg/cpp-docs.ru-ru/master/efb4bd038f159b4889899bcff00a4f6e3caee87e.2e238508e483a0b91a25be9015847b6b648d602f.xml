The C++ AMP programming model includes support for multidimensional arrays, indexing, memory transfer, and tiling. It also includes a mathematical function library. You can use C++ AMP language extensions to control how data is moved from the CPU to the GPU and back.  \n  \n## Related Topics  \n  \n|Title|Description|  \n|-----------|-----------------|  \n|[C++ AMP Overview](../../parallel/amp/cpp-amp-overview.md)|Describes the key features of C++ AMP and the mathematical library.|  \n|[Using Lambdas, Function Objects, and Restricted Functions](../../parallel/amp/using-lambdas-function-objects-and-restricted-functions.md)|Describes how to use lambda expressions, function objects, and restricted functions in calls to the [parallel_for_each](reference/concurrency-namespace-functions-amp.md#parallel_for_each) method.|  \n|[Using Tiles](../../parallel/amp/using-tiles.md)|Describes how to use tiles to accelerate your C++ AMP code.|  \n|[Using accelerator and accelerator_view Objects](../../parallel/amp/using-accelerator-and-accelerator-view-objects.md)|Describes how to use accelerators to customize execution of your code on the GPU.|  \n|[Using C++ AMP in Windows Store Apps](../../parallel/amp/using-cpp-amp-in-windows-store-apps.md)|Describes how to use C++ AMP in [!INCLUDE[win8_appname_long](../../build/includes/win8_appname_long_md.md)] apps that use Windows Runtime types.|  \n|[Graphics (C++ AMP)](../../parallel/amp/graphics-cpp-amp.md)|Describes how to use the C++ AMP graphics library.|  \n|[Walkthrough: Matrix Multiplication](../../parallel/amp/walkthrough-matrix-multiplication.md)|Demonstrates matrix multiplication using C++ AMP code and tiling.|  \n|[Walkthrough: Debugging a C++ AMP Application](../../parallel/amp/walkthrough-debugging-a-cpp-amp-application.md)|Explains how to create and debug an application that uses parallel reduction to sum up a large array of integers.|  \n  \n## Reference  \n [Reference (C++ AMP)](../../parallel/amp/reference/reference-cpp-amp.md)  \n  \n [tile_static Keyword](../../cpp/tile-static-keyword.md)  \n  \n [restrict (C++ AMP)](../../cpp/restrict-cpp-amp.md)  \n  \n## Other Resources  \n [Parallel Programming in Native Code Blog](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/linkid=238472)  \n  \n [C++ AMP sample projects for download](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/linkid=248508)  \n  \n [Analyzing C++ AMP Code with the Concurrency Visualizer](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/linkid=253987&clcid=0x409)\n\n"}
