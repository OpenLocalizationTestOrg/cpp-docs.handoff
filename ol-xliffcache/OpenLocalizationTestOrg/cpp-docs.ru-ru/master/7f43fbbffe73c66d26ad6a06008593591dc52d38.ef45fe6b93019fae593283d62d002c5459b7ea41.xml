A stream is defined by an [EDITSTREAM](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb787891) structure, which specifies a buffer and an application-defined callback function.  \n  \n To read data into a rich edit control (that is, stream the data in), use the [StreamIn](../mfc/reference/cricheditctrl-class.md#cricheditctrl__streamin) member function. The control repeatedly calls the application-defined callback function, which transfers a portion of the data into the buffer each time.  \n  \n To save the contents of a rich edit control (that is, stream the data out), you can use the [StreamOut](../mfc/reference/cricheditctrl-class.md#cricheditctrl__streamout) member function. The control repeatedly writes to the buffer and then calls the application-defined callback function. For each call, the callback function saves the contents of the buffer.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Using CRichEditCtrl](../mfc/using-cricheditctrl.md)   \n [Controls](../mfc/controls-mfc.md)\n\n"}
