makefile projects when certain project settings, or compiler options, are set up incorrectly. Use this procedure to configure Visual C++ makefile projects, so that IntelliSense works when makefile projects are open in the Visual Studio development environment.  \n  \n### To enable IntelliSense for makefile projects in the IDE  \n  \n1.  Open the **Property Pages** dialog box. For details, see [Working with Project Properties](../ide/working-with-project-properties.md).  \n  \n2.  Expand the **Configuration Properties** node.  \n  \n3.  Select the **NMake** property page, and then modify properties under **IntelliSense** as appropriate.  \n  \n    -   Set the **Preprocessor Definitions** property to define any preprocessor symbols in your makefile project. See [/D (Preprocessor Definitions)](../build/reference/d-preprocessor-definitions.md), for more information.  \n  \n    -   Set the **Include Search Path** property to specify the list of directories that the compiler will search to resolve file references that are passed to preprocessor directives in your makefile project. See [/I (Additional Include Directories)](../build/reference/i-additional-include-directories.md), for more information.  \n  \n         For projects that are built using CL.EXE from a Command Window, set the **INCLUDE** environment variable to specify directories that the compiler will search to resolve file references that are passed to preprocessor directives in your makefile project.  \n  \n    -   Set the **Forced Includes** property to specify which header files to process when building your makefile project. See [/FI (Name Forced Include File)](../build/reference/fi-name-forced-include-file.md), for more information.  \n  \n    -   Set the **Assembly Search Path** property to specify the list of directories that the compiler will search to resolve references to .NET assemblies in your project. See [/AI (Specify Metadata Directories)](../build/reference/ai-specify-metadata-directories.md), for more information.  \n  \n    -   Set the **Forced Using Assemblies** property to specify which .NET assemblies to process when building your makefile project. See [/FU (Name Forced #using File)](../build/reference/fu-name-forced-hash-using-file.md), for more information.  \n  \n    -   Set the **Additional Options** property to specify additional compiler switches to be used by Intellisense when parsing C++ files.  \n  \n4.  Click **OK** to close the property pages.  \n  \n5.  Use the **Save All** command to save the modified project settings.  \n  \n The next time you open your makefile project in the Visual Studio development environment, run the **Clean Solution** command and then the **Build Solution** command on your makefile project. IntelliSense should work properly in the IDE.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Using IntelliSense](/visualstudio/ide/using-intellisense)   \n [NMAKE Reference](../build/nmake-reference.md)   \n [How to: Create a C++ Project from Existing Code](../ide/how-to-create-a-cpp-project-from-existing-code.md)"}
