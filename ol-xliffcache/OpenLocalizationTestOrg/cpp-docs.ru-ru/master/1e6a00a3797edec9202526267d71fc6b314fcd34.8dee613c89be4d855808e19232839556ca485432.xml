These best practices apply to the [Parallel Patterns Library](../../parallel/concrt/parallel-patterns-library-ppl.md) (PPL), the [Asynchronous Agents Library](../../parallel/concrt/asynchronous-agents-library.md), and the [Task Scheduler](../../parallel/concrt/task-scheduler-concurrency-runtime.md).  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Best Practices in the Parallel Patterns Library](../../parallel/concrt/best-practices-in-the-parallel-patterns-library.md)  \n Describes the best practices to follow when you use the Parallel Patterns Library (PPL).  \n  \n [Best Practices in the Asynchronous Agents Library](../../parallel/concrt/best-practices-in-the-asynchronous-agents-library.md)  \n Describes the best practices to follow when you use the Asynchronous Agents Library.  \n  \n [General Best Practices in the Concurrency Runtime](../../parallel/concrt/general-best-practices-in-the-concurrency-runtime.md)  \n Describes best practices that apply to multiple areas of the Concurrency Runtime.  \n  \n## Related Sections  \n [Concurrency Runtime](../../parallel/concrt/concurrency-runtime.md)  \n Introduces the Concurrency Runtime, a concurrency framework for C++.  \n  \n [Parallel Patterns Library (PPL)](../../parallel/concrt/parallel-patterns-library-ppl.md)  \n Describes how to use various parallel patterns, for example, parallel algorithms, in your applications.  \n  \n [Asynchronous Agents Library](../../parallel/concrt/asynchronous-agents-library.md)  \n Describes how to use asynchronous agents in your applications.  \n  \n [Synchronization Data Structures](../../parallel/concrt/synchronization-data-structures.md)  \n Describes the various synchronization primitives that the Concurrency Runtime provides.  \n  \n [Task Scheduler](../../parallel/concrt/task-scheduler-concurrency-runtime.md)  \n Describes how to use the Task Scheduler to adjust the performance of your applications.\n\n"}
