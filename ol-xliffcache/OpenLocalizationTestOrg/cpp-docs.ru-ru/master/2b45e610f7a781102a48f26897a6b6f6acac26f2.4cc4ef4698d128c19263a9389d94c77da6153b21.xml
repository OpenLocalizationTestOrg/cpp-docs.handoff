Once you create the project, you can view and edit the project's properties in the project's [property page](../ide/working-with-project-properties.md).  \n  \n## Overview  \n This wizard page describes the current project settings for the project you are creating. By default, the project is set up to build both debug and release configurations of *ProjName*.exe.  \n  \n To change these defaults, click the [Application Settings](../ide/application-settings-makefile-project-wizard.md) tab in the left column of the wizard and make the desired changes.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Creating a Makefile Project](../ide/creating-a-makefile-project.md)   \n [NMAKE Reference](../build/nmake-reference.md)   \n [Special Characters in a Makefile](../build/special-characters-in-a-makefile.md)   \n [Contents of a Makefile](../build/contents-of-a-makefile.md)"}
