The members of the `TOOLTIPTEXT`structure are:  \n  \n `typedef struct {`  \n  \n `NMHDR     hdr;        // required for all WM_NOTIFY messages`  \n  \n `LPTSTR    lpszText;   // see below`  \n  \n `TCHAR     szText[80]; // buffer for tool tip text`  \n  \n `HINSTANCE hinst;      // see below`  \n  \n `UINT      uflags;     // flag indicating how to interpret the`  \n  \n `// idFrom member of the NMHDR structure`  \n  \n `// that is included in the structure`  \n  \n `} TOOLTIPTEXT, FAR *LPTOOLTIPTEXT;`  \n  \n `hdr`  \n Identifies the tool that needs text. The only member of this structure you might need is the control's command ID. The control's command ID will be in the `idFrom` member of the `NMHDR` structure, accessed with the syntax `hdr.idFrom`. See [NMHDR](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb775514) for a discussion of members of the `NMHDR` structure.  \n  \n `lpszText`  \n Address of a string to receive the text for a tool.  \n  \n `szText`  \n Buffer that receives the tool tip text. An application can copy the text to this buffer as an alternative to specifying a string address.  \n  \n `hinst`  \n Handle of the instance that contains a string to be used as the tool tip text. If `lpszText` is the address of the tool tip text, this member is NULL.  \n  \n When you handle the `TTN_NEEDTEXT` notification message, specify the string to be displayed in one of the following ways:  \n  \n-   Copy the text to the buffer specified by the `szText` member.  \n  \n-   Copy the address of the buffer that contains the text to the `lpszText` member.  \n  \n-   Copy the identifier of a string resource to the `lpszText` member, and copy the handle of the instance that contains the resource to the `hinst` member.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Tool Tips in Windows Not Derived from CFrameWnd](../mfc/tool-tips-in-windows-not-derived-from-cframewnd.md)\n\n"}
