For example, in Visual Studio, the MFC wizard-generated manifest file defines which of the Windows common control DLLs the application should use, version 5.0 or 6.0:  \n  \n```  \n<description>Your app description here</description>   \n<dependency>   \n    <dependentAssembly>   \n        <assemblyIdentity   \n            type=\"win32\"   \n            name=\"Microsoft.Windows.Common-Controls\"   \n            version=\"6.0.0.0\"   \n            processorArchitecture=\"X86\"   \n            publicKeyToken=\"6595b64144ccf1df\"   \n            language=\"*\"   \n        />   \n    </dependentAssembly>   \n</dependency>   \n```  \n  \n For a Windows XP or Windows Vista application, the manifest resource not only specifies that the application use the most current version of the Windows common controls (v6.0, as seen above) but it also supports the [Syslink control](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb760706).  \n  \n To view the version and type information contained in a manifest resource, you can open the file in an XML viewer or in the Visual Studio [Text Editor](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/508e1f18-99d5-48ad-b5ad-d011b21c6ab1). For more information, see [Opening a manifest resource in the Visual Studio Text Editor](../windows/how-to-open-a-manifest-resource.md).  \n  \n For information on adding resources to managed projects, please see [Resources in Applications](http://msdn.microsoft.com/Library/8ad495d4-2941-40cf-bf64-e82e85825890) in the *.NET Framework Developer's Guide.* For information on manually adding resource files to managed projects, accessing resources, displaying static resources, and assigning resources strings to properties, see  [Walkthrough: Using Resources for Localization with ASP.NET](http://msdn.microsoft.com/Library/bb4e5b44-e2b0-48ab-bbe9-609fb33900b6).  \n  \n## Limitations  \n You can only have one manifest resource per module.  \n  \n## Requirements  \n Win32  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Controls](../mfc/controls-mfc.md)   \n [Working with Resource Files](../mfc/working-with-resource-files.md)"}
