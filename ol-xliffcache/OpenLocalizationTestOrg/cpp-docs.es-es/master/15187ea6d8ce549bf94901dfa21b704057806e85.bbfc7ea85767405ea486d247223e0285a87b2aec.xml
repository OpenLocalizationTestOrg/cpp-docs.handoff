For more information about ConcRT, see [Concurrency Runtime](../parallel/concrt/concurrency-runtime.md).  \n  \n## Syntax  \n  \n```cpp  \n#include <condition_variable>  \n```  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  In code that is compiled by using **/clr** or **/clr:pure**, this header is blocked.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n Code that waits for a condition variable must also use a `mutex`. A calling thread must lock the `mutex` before it calls the functions that wait for the condition variable. The `mutex` is then locked when the called function returns. The `mutex` is not locked while the thread waits for the condition to become true. So that there are no unpredictable results, each thread that waits for a condition variable must use the same `mutex` object.  \n  \n Objects of type `condition_variable_any` can be used with a mutex of any type. The type of the mutex that is used does not have to provide the `try_lock` method. Objects of type `condition_variable` can only be used with a mutex of type `unique_lock<mutex>`. Objects of this type may be faster than objects of type `condition_variable_any<unique_lock<mutex>>`.  \n  \n To wait for an event, first lock the mutex, and then call one of the `wait` methods on the condition variable. The `wait` call blocks until another thread signals the condition variable.  \n  \n *Spurious wakeups* occur when threads that are waiting for condition variables become unblocked without appropriate notifications. To recognize such spurious wakeups, code that waits for a condition to become true should explicitly check that condition when the code returns from a wait function. This is usually done by using a loop; you can use `wait(unique_lock<mutex>& lock, Predicate pred)` to perform this loop for you.  \n  \n```cpp\nwhile (condition is false)\n    wait for condition variable;\n```  \n  \n The `condition_variable_any` and `condition_variable` classes each have three methods that wait for a condition.  \n  \n- `wait` waits for an unbounded time period.  \n  \n- `wait_until` waits until a specified `time`.  \n  \n- `wait_for` waits for a specified `time interval`.  \n  \n Each of these methods has two overloaded versions. One just waits and can wake up spuriously. The other takes an additional template argument that defines a predicate. The method does not return until the predicate is `true`.  \n  \n Each class also has two methods that are used to notify a condition variable that its condition is `true`.  \n  \n- `notify_one` wakes up one of the threads that is waiting for the condition variable.  \n  \n- `notify_all` wakes up all of the threads that are waiting for the condition variable.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Header Files Reference](../standard-library/cpp-standard-library-header-files.md)   \n [condition_variable Class](../standard-library/condition-variable-class.md)   \n [condition_variable_any Class](../standard-library/condition-variable-any-class.md)\n"}
