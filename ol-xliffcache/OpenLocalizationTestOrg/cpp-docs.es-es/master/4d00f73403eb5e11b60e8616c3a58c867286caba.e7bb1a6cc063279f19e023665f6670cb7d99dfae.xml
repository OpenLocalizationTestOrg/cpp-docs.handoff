These functions might be faster because they do not incur the overhead of locking out other threads. Use these functions only in thread-safe contexts such as single-threaded applications or where the calling scope already handles thread isolation.  \n  \n## Requirements  \n  \n|Function|Required header|  \n|--------------|---------------------|  \n|`fseek`|\\<stdio.h>|  \n|`_fseeki64`|\\<stdio.h>|  \n  \n For additional compatibility information, see [Compatibility](../../c-runtime-library/compatibility.md) in the Introduction.  \n  \n## .NET Framework Equivalent  \n  \n-   [System::IO::FileStream::Position](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.io.filestream.position.aspx)  \n  \n-   [System::IO::FileStream::Seek](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.io.filestream.seek.aspx)  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Stream I/O](../../c-runtime-library/stream-i-o.md)   \n [ftell, _ftelli64](../../c-runtime-library/reference/ftell-ftelli64.md)   \n [_lseek, _lseeki64](../../c-runtime-library/reference/lseek-lseeki64.md)   \n [rewind](../../c-runtime-library/reference/rewind.md)"}
