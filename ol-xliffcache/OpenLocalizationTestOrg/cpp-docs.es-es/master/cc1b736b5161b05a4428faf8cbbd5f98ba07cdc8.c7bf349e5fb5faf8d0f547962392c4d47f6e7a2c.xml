If the control is specified in a dialog box template, creation is automatic when the dialog box is created. (You should have a [CAnimateCtrl](../mfc/reference/canimatectrl-class.md) member in your dialog class that corresponds to the animation control.) Alternatively, you can use the [Create](../mfc/reference/canimatectrl-class.md#canimatectrl__create) member function to create the control as a child window of any window.  \n  \n-   Load an AVI clip into the animation control by calling the [Open](../mfc/reference/canimatectrl-class.md#canimatectrl__open) member function. If your animation control is in a dialog box, a good place to do this is in the dialog class's [OnInitDialog](../mfc/reference/cdialog-class.md#cdialog__oninitdialog) function.  \n  \n-   Play the clip by calling the [Play](../mfc/reference/canimatectrl-class.md#canimatectrl__play) member function. If your animation control is in a dialog box, a good place to do this is in the dialog class's **OnInitDialog** function. Calling **Play** is not necessary if the animation control has the `ACS_AUTOPLAY` style set.  \n  \n-   If you want to display portions of the clip or play it frame by frame, use the `Seek` member function. To stop a clip that is playing, use the `Stop` member function.  \n  \n-   If you are not going to destroy the control right away, remove the clip from memory by calling the **Close** member function.  \n  \n-   If the animation control is in a dialog box, it and the `CAnimateCtrl` object will be destroyed automatically. If not, you need to ensure that both the control and the `CAnimateCtrl` object are properly destroyed. Destroying the control automatically closes the AVI clip.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Using CAnimateCtrl](../mfc/using-canimatectrl.md)   \n [Controls](../mfc/controls-mfc.md)\n\n"}
