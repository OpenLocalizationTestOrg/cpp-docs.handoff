This warning is emitted when compiler finds that `__alignof` for the variable in *file1* differs from `__alignof` for the variable in *file2*. This can be caused by using incompatible types when declaring variable in different files, or by using non-matching `#pragma pack` in different files.  \n  \n To resolve this warning, either use the same type definition or use different names for the variables.  \n  \n For more information, see [pack](../../preprocessor/pack.md) and [__alignof Operator](../../cpp/alignof-operator.md).  \n  \n## Example  \n This is the first file that defines the type.  \n  \n```  \n// C4742a.c  \n// compile with: /c  \nstruct X {  \n   char x, y, z, w;  \n} global;  \n```  \n  \n## Example  \n The following sample generates C4742.  \n  \n```  \n// C4742b.c  \n// compile with: C4742a.c /W1 /GL  \n// C4742 expected  \nextern struct X {  \n   int a;  \n} global;  \n  \nint main() {  \n   global.a = 0;  \n}  \n```"}
