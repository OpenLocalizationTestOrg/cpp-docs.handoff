**false** if sets are equal.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The comparison between set objects is based on a pairwise comparison between their elements. Two sets are equal if they have the same number of elements and their respective elements have the same values. Otherwise, they are unequal.  \n  \n### Example  \n  \n```cpp  \n// set_op_ne.cpp  \n// compile with: /EHsc  \n#include <set>  \n#include <iostream>  \n  \nint main( )  \n{  \n   using namespace std;  \n   set <int> s1, s2, s3;  \n   int i;  \n  \n   for ( i = 0 ; i < 3 ; i++ )  \n   {  \n      s1.insert ( i );  \n      s2.insert ( i * i );  \n      s3.insert ( i );  \n   }  \n  \n   if ( s1 != s2 )  \n      cout << \"The sets s1 and s2 are not equal.\" << endl;  \n   else  \n      cout << \"The sets s1 and s2 are equal.\" << endl;  \n  \n   if ( s1 != s3 )  \n      cout << \"The sets s1 and s3 are not equal.\" << endl;  \n   else  \n      cout << \"The sets s1 and s3 are equal.\" << endl;  \n}  \n\\* Output:   \nThe sets s1 and s2 are not equal.  \nThe sets s1 and s3 are equal.  \n*\\  \n```  \n  \n##  <a name=\"operator_lt_\"></a>  operator&lt; (set)  \n Tests if the set object on the left side of the operator is less than the set object on the right side.  \n  \n```\nbool operator<(const set <Key, Traits, Allocator>& left, const set <Key, Traits, Allocator>& right);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `left`  \n An object of type **set**.  \n  \n `right`  \n An object of type **set**.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n **true** if the set on the left side of the operator is strictly less than the set on the right side of the operator; otherwise **false**.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The comparison between set objects is based on a pairwise comparison of their elements. The less-than relationship between two objects is based on a comparison of the first pair of unequal elements.  \n  \n### Example  \n  \n```cpp  \n// set_op_lt.cpp  \n// compile with: /EHsc  \n#include <set>  \n#include <iostream>  \n  \nint main( )  \n{  \n   using namespace std;  \n   set <int> s1, s2, s3;  \n   int i;  \n  \n   for ( i = 0 ; i < 3 ; i++ )  \n   {  \n      s1.insert ( i );  \n      s2.insert ( i * i );  \n      s3.insert ( i - 1 );  \n   }  \n  \n   if ( s1 < s2 )  \n      cout << \"The set s1 is less than the set s2.\" << endl;  \n   else  \n      cout << \"The set s1 is not less than the set s2.\" << endl;  \n  \n   if ( s1 < s3 )  \n      cout << \"The set s1 is less than the set s3.\" << endl;  \n   else  \n      cout << \"The set s1 is not less than the set s3.\" << endl;  \n}  \n\\* Output:   \nThe set s1 is less than the set s2.  \nThe set s1 is not less than the set s3.  \n*\\  \n```  \n  \n##  <a name=\"operator_lt__eq\"></a>  operator&lt;= (set)  \n Tests if the set object on the left side of the operator is less than or equal to the set object on the right side.  \n  \n```\nbool operator!<=(const set <Key, Traits, Allocator>& left, const set <Key, Traits, Allocator>& right);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `left`  \n An object of type **set**.  \n  \n `right`  \n An object of type **set**.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n **true** if the set on the left side of the operator is less than or equal to the set on the right side of the operator; otherwise **false**.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The comparison between set objects is based on a pairwise comparison of their elements.
