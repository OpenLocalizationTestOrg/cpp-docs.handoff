Use the **NonSerializedAttribute** custom attribute to exempt fields or properties of a managed class from being serialized.  \n  \n## Example  \n  \n### Description  \n In the following example, the class `MyClass` (and the property `m_nCount`) is marked as serializable. However, the `m_nData` property is not serialized as indicated by the **NonSerialized** custom attribute:  \n  \n### Code  \n  \n```  \n// serialization_and_mcpp.cpp  \n// compile with: /LD /clr  \nusing namespace System;  \n  \n[ Serializable ]  \npublic ref class MyClass {  \npublic:  \n   int m_nCount;  \nprivate:  \n   [ NonSerialized ]  \n   int m_nData;  \n};  \n```  \n  \n### Comments  \n Note that both attributes can be referenced using their \"short name\" (**Serializable** and **NonSerialized**). This is further explained in [Applying Attributes](http://msdn.microsoft.com/Library/dd7604eb-9fa3-4b60-b2dd-b47739fa3148).  \n  \n## See Also  \n [.NET Programming with C++/CLI (Visual C++)](../dotnet/dotnet-programming-with-cpp-cli-visual-cpp.md)"}
