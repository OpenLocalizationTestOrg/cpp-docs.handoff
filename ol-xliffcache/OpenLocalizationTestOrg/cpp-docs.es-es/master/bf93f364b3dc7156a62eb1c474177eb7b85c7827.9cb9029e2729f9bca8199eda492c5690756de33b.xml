displayed in its decorated form, was multiply defined.  \n  \nFor more information, see the Knowledge Base articles:  \n  \n-   [A LNK2005 error occurs when the CRT library and MFC libraries are linked in the wrong order in Visual C++](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/148652)  \n  \n-   [FIX: Global Overloaded Delete Operator Causes LNK2005](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/140440)  \n  \n-   [You receive LNK2005 errors when you compile an ATL executable (.exe) project in Visual C++](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/184235).  \n  \nThis error is followed by fatal error [LNK1169](../../error-messages/tool-errors/linker-tools-error-lnk1169.md).  \n  \n### To fix by checking the following possible causes  \n  \n1.  Mixing static and dynamic libraries when also using [/clr](../../build/reference/clr-common-language-runtime-compilation.md).  \n  \n2.  The symbol is a packaged function (created by compiling with [/Gy](../../build/reference/gy-enable-function-level-linking.md)) and was included in more than one file but was changed between compilations. Recompile all files that include `symbol`.  \n  \n3.  The symbol is defined differently in two member objects in different libraries, and both member objects were used.  \n  \n4.  An absolute is defined twice, with a different value in each definition.  \n  \n5.  A header file declared and defined a variable. Possible solutions include:  \n  \n    -   Declare the variable in .h: `extern BOOL MyBool;` and then assign to it in a .c or .cpp file: `BOOL MyBool = FALSE;`.  \n  \n    -   Declare the variable [static](../../cpp/storage-classes-cpp.md#static).  \n  \n    -   Declare the variable [selectany](../../cpp/selectany.md).  \n  \n6.  If you use uuid.lib in combination with other .lib files that define GUIDs (for example, oledb.lib and adsiid.lib). For example:  \n  \n    ```  \n    oledb.lib(oledb_i.obj) : error LNK2005: _IID_ITransactionObject  \n    already defined in uuid.lib(go7.obj)  \n    ```  \n  \n     To fix, add [/FORCE:MULTIPLE](../../build/reference/force-force-file-output.md) to the linker command line options, and make sure that uuid.lib is the first library referenced."}
