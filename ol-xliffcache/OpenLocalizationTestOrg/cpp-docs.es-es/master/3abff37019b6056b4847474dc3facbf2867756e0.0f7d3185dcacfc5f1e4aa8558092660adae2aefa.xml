Some are unique to C++, and some are essentially the same for all Visual Studio languages. Options for enabling and configuring these features are located in the **Text Editor C++ Advanced** dialog (**Tools &#124; Options &#124; Text Editor &#124; C/C++ &#124; Advanced** or type \"C++ Advanced\" in **Quick Launch**). After choosing which option you want to set, you can get more help by pressing **F1** when the dialog is in focus. For general code formatting options, type `Editor C++` into **QuickLaunch**.  \n  \n## Adding new code  \n After creating a project, you can start coding in the files that were generated for you. To add new files, right-click on the project node in Solution Explorer and choose **Add &#124; New**.  \n  \n To set formatting options such as indents, brace completion, and colorization, type `C++ Formatting` into the **QuickLaunch** window.  \n  \n### IntelliSense  \n IntelliSense is the name for a set of features that provide inline information about members, types, and function overloads. The following illustration shows the member list drop-down that appears as you type. You can press the tab key to enter the selected item text into your code file.  \n  \n ![C&#43;&#43; member list drop down](../ide/media/vs2015_cpp_statement_completion.png \"vs2015_cpp_statement_completion\")  \n  \n For complete information see [Visual C++ Intellisense](/visualstudio/ide/visual-cpp-intellisense).  \n  \n### Insert Snippets  \n A snippet is a predefined piece of source code. Right-click on a single point or on selected text to either insert a snippet or surround the selected text with the snippet. The following illustration shows the three steps to surround a selected statement with a for loop. The yellow highlights in the final image are editable fields that you access with the tab key. For more information, see [Code Snippets](/visualstudio/ide/code-snippets).  \n  \n ![Visual C&#43;&#43; Insert Snippet Drop&#45;down](../ide/media/vs2015_cpp_surround_with.png \"vs2015_cpp_surround_with\")  \n  \n### Add Class  \n Add a new class from the **Project** menu by using the Class Wizard.  \n  \n ![Add New Class in Visual C&#43;&#43;](../ide/media/vs2015_cpp_add_class.png \"vs2015_cpp_add_class\")  \n  \n### Class Wizard  \n Modify or examine an existing class, or add a new class, using the Class Wizard. For more information, see [Adding Functionality with Code Wizards (C++)](../ide/adding-functionality-with-code-wizards-cpp.md).  \n  \n ![Visual C&#43;&#43; Class Wizard](../ide/media/vs2015_cpp_class_wizard.png \"vs2015_cpp_class_wizard\")  \n  \n## Refactoring  \n Refactorings are available under the Quick Action context menu, or by clicking on a [light bulb](/visualstudio/ide/perform-quick-actions-with-light-bulbs) in the editor.  Some are also found in the **Edit > Refactor** menu.  These features include:\n\n* [Rename](refactoring/rename.md)\n* [Extract Function](refactoring/extract-function.md)\n* [Implement Pure Virtuals](refactoring/implement-pure-virtuals.md)\n* [Create Declaration / Definition](refactoring/create-declaration-definition.md)\n* [Move Function Definition](refactoring/move-definition-location.md)\n* [Convert to Raw String Literal](refactoring/convert-to-raw-string-literal.md)\n* [Change Signature](refactoring/change-signature.md)\n \n## Navigate and understand\n  \n### QuickInfo  \n Hover over a variable to see its type information. QuickInfo  \n  \n ![Visual C&#43;&#43; QuickInfo](../ide/media/vs2015_cpp_quickinfo.png \"vs2015_cpp_quickInfo\")  \n  \n### Open document (Navigate to header)  \n Right click on the header name in an `#include` directive and open the header file.  \n  \n ![Visual C&#43;&#43; Open Document menu option](../ide/media/vs2015_cpp_open_document.png \"vs2015_cpp_open_document\")  \n  \n### Peek Definition  \n Hover over a variable or function declaration, right-click, then choose **Peek Definition** to see an inline view of its definition. For more information, see [Peek Definition (Alt+F12)](/visualstudio/ide/how-to-view-and-edit-code-by-using-peek-definition-alt-plus-f12).  \n  \n ![Visual C&#43;&#43; Peek Definition](../ide/media/vs2015_cpp_peek_definition.png \"vs2015_cpp_peek_definition\")  \n  \n### Go To Definition  \n Hover over a variable or function declaration, right-click, then choose **Go To Definition** to open the document where the object is defined.  \n  \n### View Call Hierarchy  \n Right click on any function call and view a resursive list of all the functions that it calls, and all the functions that call it. Each function in the list can be expanded in the same way. For more information, see [Call Hierarchy](/visualstudio/ide/reference/call-hierarchy).  \n  \n ![Visual C&#43;&#43; Call Hierarchy](../ide/media/vs2015_cpp_call_hierarchy.png \"vs2015_cpp_call_hierarchy\")  \n  \n### Toggle Header / Code File  \n Right-click and choose Toggle Header / Code File to switch back and forth between a header file and its associated code file.  \n  \n### Outlining  \n Right-click anywhere in a source code file and choose **Outlining** to collapse or expand definitions and/or custom regions to make it easier to browse only the parts you are interested in. For more information, see [Outlining](/visualstudio/ide/outlining).  \n  \n ![Visual C&#43;&#43; Outlining](../ide/media/vs2015_cpp_outlining.png \"vs2015_cpp_outlining\")  \n  \n### Scroll bar map mode  \n Scrollbar map mode enables you to quickly scroll and browse through a code file without actually leaving your current location. Or click anywhere on the code map to go directly to that location.  \n  \n ![Code Map in Visual C&#43;&#43;](../ide/media/vs2015_cpp_code_map.png \"vs2015_cpp_code_map\")  \n  \n### Generate graph of include files  \n Right click on a code file in your project and choose **Generate graph of include files** to see a graph of which files are included by other files.  \n  \n ![Visual C&#43;&#43; graph of include files](../ide/media/vs2015_cpp_include_graph.png \"vs2015_cpp_include_graph\")  \n  \n### F1 Help  \n Place the cursor on or just after any type, keyword or function and press F1 to go directly to the relevant MSDN reference topic. F1 also works on items in the error list, and in many dialog boxes.  \n  \n### Quick Launch  \n To easily navigate to any window or tool in Visual Studio, simply type its name in the Quick Launch window in the upper right corner of the UI. The auto-completion list will filter as you type.  \n  \n ![Visual Studio Quick Launch](../ide/media/vs2015_cpp_quick_launch.png \"vs2015_cpp_quick_launch\")"}
