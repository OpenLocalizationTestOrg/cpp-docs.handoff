/Zc:forScope (Force Conformance in for Loop Scope)\nUsed to implement standard C++ behavior for [for](../../cpp/for-statement-cpp.md) loops with Microsoft extensions ([/Ze](../../build/reference/za-ze-disable-language-extensions.md)).  **/Zc:forScope** is on by default.  \n  \n## Syntax  \n  \n```  \n/Zc:forScope[-]  \n```  \n  \n## Remarks  \n The **/Zc:forScope-** option is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Use of **/Zc:forScope-** generates deprecation warning D9035.  \n  \n Standard behavior is to let a **for** loop's initializer go out of scope after the **for** loop. Under **/Zc:forScope-** and [/Ze](../../build/reference/za-ze-disable-language-extensions.md), the **for** loop's initializer remains in scope until the local scope ends.  \n  \n The following code compiles under **/Ze** but not under **/Za**:  \n  \n```cpp  \n// zc_forScope.cpp  \n// compile by using: cl /Zc:forScope- /Za zc_forScope.cpp  \n// C2065, D9035 expected  \nint main() {  \n    // Compile by using cl /Zc:forScope- zc_forScope.cpp  \n    // to compile this non-standard code as-is.  \n    // Uncomment the following line to resolve C2065 for /Za.  \n    // int i;  \n    for (int i = 0; i < 1; i++)  \n        ;  \n    i = 20;   // i has already gone out of scope under /Za  \n}  \n```  \n  \n If you use **/Zc:forScope-**, warning C4288 (off by default) is generated if a variable is in scope because of a declaration that was made in a previous scope. To demonstrate this, remove the `//` characters in the example code to declare `int i`.  \n  \n You can modify the run-time behavior of **/Zc:forScope** by using the [conform](../../preprocessor/conform.md) pragma.  \n  \n If you use **/Zc:forScope-** in a project that has an existing .pch file, a warning is generated, **/Zc:forScope-** is ignored, and compilation continues by using the existing .pch files. If you want a new .pch file generated, use [/Yc (Create Precompiled Header File)](../../build/reference/yc-create-precompiled-header-file.md).  \n  \n For more information about conformance issues in Visual C++, see [Nonstandard Behavior](../../cpp/nonstandard-behavior.md).  \n  \n### To set this compiler option in the Visual Studio development environment  \n  \n1.  Open the project's **Property Pages** dialog box. For details, see [Working with Project Properties](../../ide/working-with-project-properties.md).  \n  \n2.  In the navigation pane, open the **Configuration Properties**, **C/C++**, **Language** property page.  \n  \n3.  Modify the **Force Conformance in For Loop Scope** property.  \n  \n### To set this compiler option programmatically  \n  \n-   See <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.VCProjectEngine.VCCLCompilerTool.ForceConformanceInForLoopScope%2A>.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [/Zc (Conformance)](../../build/reference/zc-conformance.md)   \n [/Za, /Ze (Disable Language Extensions)](../../build/reference/za-ze-disable-language-extensions.md)"}
