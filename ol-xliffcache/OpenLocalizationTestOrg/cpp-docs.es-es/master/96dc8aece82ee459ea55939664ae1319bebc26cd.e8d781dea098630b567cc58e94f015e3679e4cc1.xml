For more information, see [CRT functions not supported with /ZW](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/jj606124.aspx).  \n  \n## Syntax  \n  \n```  \n  \n      FILE *_popen(  \nconst char *command,  \nconst char *mode   \n);  \nFILE *_wpopen(  \nconst wchar_t *command,  \nconst wchar_t *mode   \n);  \n```  \n  \n#### Parameters  \n *command*  \n Command to be executed.  \n  \n *mode*  \n Mode of the returned stream.  \n  \n## Return Value  \n Returns a stream associated with one end of the created pipe. The other end of the pipe is associated with the spawned command's standard input or standard output. The functions return **NULL** on an error. If the error is an invalid parameter, such as if *command* or *mode* is a null pointer, or *mode* is not a valid mode, `errno` is set to `EINVAL`. See the Remarks section for valid modes.  \n  \n For information about these and other error codes, see [_doserrno, errno, _sys_errlist, and _sys_nerr](../../c-runtime-library/errno-doserrno-sys-errlist-and-sys-nerr.md).  \n  \n## Remarks  \n The `_popen` function creates a pipe and asynchronously executes a spawned copy of the command processor with the specified string *command*. The character string *mode* specifies the type of access requested, as follows.  \n  \n **\"r\"**  \n The calling process can read the spawned command's standard output using the returned stream.  \n  \n **\"w\"**  \n The calling process can write to the spawned command's standard input using the returned stream.  \n  \n **\"b\"**  \n Open in binary mode.  \n  \n **\"t\"**  \n Open in text mode.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  If used in a Windows program, the `_popen` function returns an invalid file pointer that causes the program to stop responding indefinitely. `_popen` works properly in a console application.
