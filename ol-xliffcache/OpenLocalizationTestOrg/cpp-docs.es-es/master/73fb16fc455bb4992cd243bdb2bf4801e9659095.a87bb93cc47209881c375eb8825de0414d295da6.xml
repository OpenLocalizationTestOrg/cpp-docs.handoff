For a description of the four possible \"views\" (not to be confused with MFC views) you can have in a list control — icon view, small icon view, list view, and report view — see Views in the [CListCtrl](../mfc/reference/clistctrl-class.md) class overview.  \n  \n In some views, users can drag icons to different positions or edit icon labels. For example, see the right-hand pane in File Explorer, which uses a list control in a nondialog window. You can experiment with the available views in Explorer's View menu.  \n  \n For related information, see [About List-View Controls](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb774735) in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../atl/includes/winsdk_md.md)].  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../atl/includes/winsdk_md.md)] refers to list controls as \"list view controls.\" This usage of \"view\" does not refer to MFC view classes, particularly `CListView`.
