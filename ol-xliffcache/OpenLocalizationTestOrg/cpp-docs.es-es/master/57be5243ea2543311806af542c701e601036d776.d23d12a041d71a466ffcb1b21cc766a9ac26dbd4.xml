In [Class View](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/8d7430a9-3e33-454c-a9e1-a85e3d2db925), right-click the name of the interface to which you want to add the property.  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  You can also add properties to dispinterfaces, which, unless the project is attributed, are nested within the library node.  \n  \n2.  From the shortcut menu, click **Add**, and then click **Add Property**.  \n  \n3.  In the [Add Property Wizard](../ide/names-add-property-wizard.md), provide the information to create the property.  \n  \n4.  Specify any interface definition language (IDL) settings for the property in the [IDL Attributes](../ide/idl-attributes-add-property-wizard.md) page of the wizard.  \n  \n5.  Click **Finish** to add the property.  \n  \n The **Get** and `Put` methods of the property are displayed as two icons in Class View, under the interface where it is defined. You can double-click either icon to view the property declaration in the .idl file.  \n  \n-   For ATL interfaces, the **Get** and **Put** functions are added to the .cpp file, and references to these functions are added to the .h file.  \n  \n-   For MFC dispinterfaces, if you select **Member variable** as the implementation type, a method and a variable are added to the class that implements it. If you select **Get/Set methods** as the implementation type, two methods are added to the class that implements it.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Creating a COM Interface](../ide/creating-a-com-interface-visual-cpp.md)   \n [Editing a COM Interface](../ide/editing-a-com-interface.md)   \n [The Component Object Model](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms694363)   \n [Interface Pointers and Interfaces](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms688484)"}
