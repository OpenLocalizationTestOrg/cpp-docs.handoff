You can use the [Resource Symbols dialog box](../windows/resource-symbols-dialog-box.md) to change the value of symbols not currently assigned to a resource. For more information, see [Changing Unassigned Symbols](../windows/changing-unassigned-symbols.md).  \n  \n### To change a symbol value assigned to a single resource or object  \n  \n1.  In [Resource View](../windows/resource-view-window.md), select the resource.  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  If your project doesn't already contain an .rc file, please see [Creating a New Resource Script File](../windows/how-to-create-a-resource-script-file.md).  \n  \n2.  In the **Properties** window, type the symbol name followed by an equal sign and an integer in the **ID** box, for example:  \n  \n    ```  \n    IDC_EDITNAME=5100  \n    ```  \n  \n The new value is stored in the symbol header file the next time you save the project. Only the symbol name remains visible in the ID box; the equal sign and value are not displayed after they are validated.  \n  \n For information on adding resources to managed projects, please see [Resources in Applications](http://msdn.microsoft.com/Library/8ad495d4-2941-40cf-bf64-e82e85825890) in the *.NET Framework Developer's Guide.* For information on manually adding resource files to managed projects, accessing resources, displaying static resources, and assigning resources strings to properties, and [Walkthrough: Using Resources for Localization with ASP.NET](http://msdn.microsoft.com/Library/bb4e5b44-e2b0-48ab-bbe9-609fb33900b6).  \n  \n Requirements  \n  \n Win32  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Symbol Value Restrictions](../windows/symbol-value-restrictions.md)   \n [Predefined Symbol IDs](../windows/predefined-symbol-ids.md)"}
