file-permission mask. A version of [_umask](../../c-runtime-library/reference/umask.md) with security enhancements as described in [Security Features in the CRT](../../c-runtime-library/security-features-in-the-crt.md).  \n  \n## Syntax  \n  \n```  \nerrno_t _umask_s(  \n   int mode,  \n   int * pOldMode  \n);  \n```  \n  \n#### Parameters  \n [in] `mode`  \n Default permission setting.  \n  \n [out] `oldMode`  \n The previous value of the permission setting.  \n  \n## Return Value  \n Returns an error code if `Mode` does not specify a valid mode or the `pOldMode` pointer is `NULL`.  \n  \n### Error Conditions  \n  \n|`mode`|`pOldMode`|**Return Value**|**Contents of**  `oldMode`|  \n|------------|----------------|----------------------|--------------------------------|  \n|any|`NULL`|`EINVAL`|not modified|  \n|invalid mode|any|`EINVAL`|not modified|  \n  \n If one of the above conditions occurs, the invalid parameter handler is invoked, as described in [Parameter Validation](../../c-runtime-library/parameter-validation.md). If execution is allowed to continue, `_umask_s` returns `EINVAL` and sets `errno` to `EINVAL`.  \n  \n## Remarks  \n The `_umask_s` function sets the file-permission mask of the current process to the mode specified by `mode`*.* The file-permission mask modifies the permission setting of new files created by `_creat`, `_open`, or `_sopen`. If a bit in the mask is 1, the corresponding bit in the file's requested permission value is set to 0 (disallowed). If a bit in the mask is 0, the corresponding bit is left unchanged. The permission setting for a new file is not set until the file is closed for the first time.  \n  \n The integer expression `pmode` contains one or both of the following manifest constants, defined in SYS\\STAT.H:  \n  \n `_S_IWRITE`  \n Writing permitted.  \n  \n `_S_IREAD`  \n Reading permitted.  \n  \n `_S_IREAD | _S_IWRITE`  \n Reading and writing permitted.  \n  \n When both constants are given, they are joined with the bitwise-OR operator ( `|` ). If the `mode` argument is `_S_IREAD`, reading is not allowed (the file is write-only). If the `mode` argument is `_S_IWRITE`, writing is not allowed (the file is read-only). For example, if the write bit is set in the mask, any new files will be read-only. Note that with MS-DOS and the Windows operating systems, all files are readable; it is not possible to give write-only permission. Therefore, setting the read bit with `_umask_s` has no effect on the file's modes.  \n  \n If `pmode` is not a combination of one of the manifest constants or incorporates an alternate set of constants, the function will simply ignore those.  \n  \n## Requirements  \n  \n|Routine|Required header|  \n|-------------|---------------------|  \n|`_umask_s`|\\<io.h> and \\<sys/stat.h> and \\<sys/types.h>|  \n  \n For additional compatibility information, see [Compatibility](../../c-runtime-library/compatibility.md) in the Introduction.  \n  \n## Example  \n  \n```  \n// crt_umask_s.c  \n/* This program uses _umask_s to set  \n * the file-permission mask so that all future  \n * files will be created as read-only files.  \n * It also displays the old mask.  \n */  \n  \n#include <sys/stat.h>  \n#include <sys/types.h>  \n#include <io.h>  \n#include <stdio.h>  \n  \nint main( void )  \n{  \n   int oldmask, err;  \n  \n   /* Create read-only files: */  \n   err = _umask_s( _S_IWRITE, &oldmask );  \n   if (err)  \n   {  \n      printf(\"Error setting the umask.\\n\");  \n      exit(1);  \n   }  \n   printf( \"Oldmask = 0x%.4x\\n\", oldmask );  \n}  \n```  \n  \n```Output  \nOldmask = 0x0000  \n```  \n  \n## .NET Framework Equivalent  \n [System::IO::File::SetAttributes](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.io.file.setattributes.aspx)  \n  \n## See Also  \n [File Handling](../../c-runtime-library/file-handling.md)   \n [Low-Level I/O](../../c-runtime-library/low-level-i-o.md)   \n [_chmod, _wchmod](../../c-runtime-library/reference/chmod-wchmod.md)   \n [_creat, _wcreat](../../c-runtime-library/reference/creat-wcreat.md)   \n [_mkdir, _wmkdir](../../c-runtime-library/reference/mkdir-wmkdir.md)   \n [_open, _wopen](../../c-runtime-library/reference/open-wopen.md)   \n [_umask](../../c-runtime-library/reference/umask.md)"}
