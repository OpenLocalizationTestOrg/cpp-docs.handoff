Also ensure there is a **/LIBPATH** statement for each directory containing a linker-dependent file.  \n  \n Another possible cause for LNK1181 is that a long file name with embedded spaces was not enclosed in quotation marks.  In that case, the linker will only recognize a file name up to the first space, and then assume a file extension of .obj.  The solution to this situation is to enclose the long file name (path plus file name) in quotation marks.  \n  \n For more information, see [.lib Files as Linker Input](../../build/reference/dot-lib-files-as-linker-input.md).  \n  \n## See Also  \n [/LIBPATH (Additional Libpath)](../../build/reference/libpath-additional-libpath.md)"}
