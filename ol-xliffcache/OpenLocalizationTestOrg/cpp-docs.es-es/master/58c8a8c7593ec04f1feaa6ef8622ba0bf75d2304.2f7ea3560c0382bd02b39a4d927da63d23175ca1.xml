This class serves as the base class for more specific types of factories, including `COleTemplateServer`.  \n  \n [COleMessageFilter](../mfc/reference/colemessagefilter-class.md)  \n Used to manage concurrency with OLE Lightweight Remote Procedure Calls (LRPC).  \n  \n [COleStreamFile](../mfc/reference/colestreamfile-class.md)  \n Uses the COM `IStream` interface to provide `CFile` access to compound files. This class (derived from `CFile`) enables MFC serialization to use OLE structured storage.  \n  \n [CRectTracker](../mfc/reference/crecttracker-class.md)  \n Used to allow moving, resizing, and reorientation of in-place items.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Class Overview](../mfc/class-library-overview.md)\n\n"}
