Allocate a `CTime` object, as follows:  \n  \n     [!code-cpp[NVC_ATLMFC_Utilities#171](../atl-mfc-shared/codesnippet/cpp/current-time-general-purpose-classes_1.cpp)]  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  Uninitialized `CTime` objects are not initialized to a valid time.  \n  \n2.  Call the `CTime::GetCurrentTime` function to get the current time from the operating system. This function returns a `CTime` object that can be used to set the value of `CTime`, as follows:  \n  \n     [!code-cpp[NVC_ATLMFC_Utilities#172](../atl-mfc-shared/codesnippet/cpp/current-time-general-purpose-classes_2.cpp)]  \n  \n     Since `GetCurrentTime` is a static member function from the `CTime` class, you must qualify its name with the name of the class and the scope resolution operator (`::`), `CTime::GetCurrentTime()`.  \n  \n Of course, the two steps outlined previously could be combined into a single program statement as follows:  \n  \n [!code-cpp[NVC_ATLMFC_Utilities#173](../atl-mfc-shared/codesnippet/cpp/current-time-general-purpose-classes_3.cpp)]  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Date and Time: General-Purpose Classes](../atl-mfc-shared/date-and-time-general-purpose-classes.md)\n\n\n\n"}
