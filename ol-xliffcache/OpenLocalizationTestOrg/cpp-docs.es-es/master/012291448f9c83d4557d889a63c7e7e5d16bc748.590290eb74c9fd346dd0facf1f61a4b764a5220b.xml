Make sure the file exists and that the directory is not write-protected.  \n  \n Visual C++ could not create a temporary file during the build process. Reasons for this include:  \n  \n-   No temp directory.  \n  \n-   Read-only temp directory.  \n  \n-   Out of disk space.  \n  \n-   The $(IntDir) folder is either read-only or contains temporary files that are read-only.  \n  \n This error will also occur following error PRJ0007: Could not create output directory 'directory'. Error PRJ0007 means that the $(IntDir) directory could not be created, implying the creation of temporarily files will also fail.  \n  \n Temp files are created whenever you specify:  \n  \n-   A response file.  \n  \n-   A custom build step.  \n  \n-   A build event."}
