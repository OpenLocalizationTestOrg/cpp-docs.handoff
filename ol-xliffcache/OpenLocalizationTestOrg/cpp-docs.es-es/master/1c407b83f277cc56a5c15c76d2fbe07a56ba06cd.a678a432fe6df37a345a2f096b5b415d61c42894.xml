Therefore, it is possible for a function with file scope to have either internal or external linkage.  \n  \n **END Microsoft Specific**  \n  \n A class has internal linkage if it:  \n  \n-   Uses no C++ functionality (for example, member-access control, member functions, constructors, destructors, and so on).  \n  \n-   Is not used in the declaration of another name that has external linkage. This constraint means that objects of class type that are passed to functions with external linkage cause the class to have external linkage.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Program and Linkage](../cpp/program-and-linkage-cpp.md)"}
