\n## Remarks  \n An object's security descriptor can contain a DACL. A DACL contains zero or more ACEs (access-control entries) that identify the users and groups who can access the object. If a DACL is empty (that is, it contains zero ACEs), no access is explicitly granted, so access is implicitly denied. However, if an object's security descriptor does not have a DACL, the object is unprotected and everyone has complete access.  \n  \n To retrieve an object's DACL, you must be the object's owner or have READ_CONTROL access to the object. To change an object's DACL, you must have WRITE_DAC access to the object.  \n  \n Use the class methods provided to create, add, remove, and delete ACEs from the `CDacl` object.

In debug builds, passing a SACL will cause an ASSERT. In release builds, passing a SACL will cause the ACEs (access-control entries) in the ACL to be ignored, and no error will occur.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cdacl___dtorcdacl\"></a>  CDacl::~CDacl  \n The destructor.  \n  \n```\n~CDacl () throw();\n```  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The destructor frees any resources acquired by the object, including all ACEs (access-control entries) using [CDacl::RemoveAllAces](#cdacl__removeallaces).  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cdacl__getacecount\"></a>  CDacl::GetAceCount  \n Returns the number of ACEs (access-control entries) in the `CDacl` object.  \n  \n```\nUINT GetAceCount() const throw();\n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Returns the number of ACEs contained in the `CDacl` object.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cdacl__operator_eq\"></a>  CDacl::operator =  \n Assignment operator.  \n  \n```\nCDacl& operator= (const ACL& rhs) throw(...);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `rhs`  \n The ACL (access-control list) to assign to the existing object.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Returns a reference to the updated `CDacl` object.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n You should ensure that you only pass a DACL (discretionary access-control list) to this function. Passing a SACL (system access-control list) to this function will cause an ASSERT in debug builds but will cause no error in release builds.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cdacl__removeace\"></a>  CDacl::RemoveAce  \n Removes a specific ACE (access-control entry) from the `CDacl` object.  \n  \n```\nvoid RemoveAce(UINT   nIndex) throw();\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `nIndex`  \n Index to the ACE entry to remove.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n This method is derived from [CAtlArray::RemoveAt](../../atl/reference/catlarray-class.md#catlarray__removeat).  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cdacl__removeallaces\"></a>  CDacl::RemoveAllAces  \n Removes all of the ACEs (access-control entries) contained in the `CDacl` object.  \n  \n```\nvoid RemoveAllAces() throw();\n```  \n  \n### Remarks  \n Removes every **ACE** (access-control entry) structure (if any) in the `CDacl` object.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Security Sample](../../visual-cpp-samples.md)   \n [CAcl Class](../../atl/reference/cacl-class.md)   \n [ACLs](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa374872)   \n [ACEs](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa374868)   \n [Class Overview](../../atl/atl-class-overview.md)   \n [Security Global Functions](../../atl/reference/security-global-functions.md)\n"}
