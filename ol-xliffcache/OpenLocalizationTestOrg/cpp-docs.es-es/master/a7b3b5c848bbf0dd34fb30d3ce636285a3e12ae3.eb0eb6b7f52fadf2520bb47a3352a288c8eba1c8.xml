To use a local class member function, you must define it in the class. You cannot declare it in class and define it out of class.  \n  \n Any out-of-class definition for a local class member function will be an error.  \n  \n The following sample generates C4822:  \n  \n```  \n// C4822.cpp  \n// compile with: /W1  \nint main() {  \n   struct C {  \n      void func1(int);   // C4822  \n      // try the following line instead  \n      // void func1(int){}  \n  };  \n}  \n```"}
