Naked functions are provided as an advanced feature. They enable you to declare a function that is being called from a context other than C/C++, and thus make different assumptions about where parameters are, or which registers are preserved. Examples include routines such as interrupt handlers. This feature is particularly useful for writers of virtual device drivers (VxDs).  \n  \n## What do you want to know more about?  \n  \n-   [naked](../cpp/naked-cpp.md)  \n  \n-   [Rules and Limitations for Naked Functions](../cpp/rules-and-limitations-for-naked-functions.md)  \n  \n-   [Considerations for Writing Prolog/Epilog Code](../cpp/considerations-for-writing-prolog-epilog-code.md)  \n  \n### END Microsoft Specific  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Calling Conventions](../cpp/calling-conventions.md)"}
