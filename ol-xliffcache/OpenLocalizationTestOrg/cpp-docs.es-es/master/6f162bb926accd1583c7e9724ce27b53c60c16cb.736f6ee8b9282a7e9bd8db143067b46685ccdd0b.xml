&lt;ios&gt;\nDefines several types and functions basic to the operation of iostreams. This header is typically included for you by another iostream headers; you rarely include it directly.  \n  \n## Syntax  \n  \n```  \n#include <ios>  \n  \n```  \n  \n## Remarks  \n A large group of functions are manipulators. A manipulator declared in \\<ios> alters the values stored in its argument object of class [ios_base](../standard-library/ios-base-class.md). Other manipulators perform actions on streams controlled by objects of a type derived from this class, such as a specialization of one of the template classes [basic_istream](../standard-library/basic-istream-class.md) or [basic_ostream](../standard-library/basic-ostream-class.md). For example, [noskipws](../standard-library/ios-functions.md#noskipws)(**str**) clears the format flag `ios_base::skipws` in the object **str**, which can be of one of these types.  \n  \n You can also call a manipulator by inserting it into an output stream or extracting it from an input stream, because of special insertion and extraction operations supplied for the classes derived from `ios_base`. For example:  \n  \n```\nistr>> noskipws;\n```  \n  \n calls [noskipws](../standard-library/ios-functions.md#noskipws)(**istr**).  \n  \n### Typedefs  \n  \n|||  \n|-|-|
