A character constant has `int` type. An integer constant has `int`, **long**, `unsigned int`, or `unsigned long` type, depending on the integer's size and on the way the value is specified. See [Constants](../c-language/c-constants.md) for more information.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [C Primary Expressions](../c-language/c-primary-expressions.md)"}
