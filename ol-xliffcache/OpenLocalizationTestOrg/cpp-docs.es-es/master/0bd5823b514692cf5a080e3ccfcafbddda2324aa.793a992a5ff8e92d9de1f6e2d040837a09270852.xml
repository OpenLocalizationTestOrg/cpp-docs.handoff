It is also useful to know how to use the **__LOCAL_SIZE** symbol.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"_pluslang_c.2b2b_.stack_frame_layout\"></a> Stack Frame Layout  \n This example shows the standard prolog code that might appear in a 32-bit function:  \n  \n```  \npush        ebp                ; Save ebp  \nmov         ebp, esp           ; Set stack frame pointer  \nsub         esp, localbytes    ; Allocate space for locals  \npush        <registers>        ; Save registers  \n```  \n  \n The `localbytes` variable represents the number of bytes needed on the stack for local variables, and the `<registers>` variable is a placeholder that represents the list of registers to be saved on the stack. After pushing the registers, you can place any other appropriate data on the stack. The following is the corresponding epilog code:  \n  \n```  \npop         <registers>   ; Restore registers  \nmov         esp, ebp      ; Restore stack pointer  \npop         ebp           ; Restore ebp  \nret                       ; Return from function  \n```  \n  \n The stack always grows down (from high to low memory addresses). The base pointer (`ebp`) points to the pushed value of `ebp`. The locals area begins at `ebp-4`. To access local variables, calculate an offset from `ebp` by subtracting the appropriate value from `ebp`.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"_pluslang___local_size\"></a> __LOCAL_SIZE  \n The compiler provides a symbol, **__LOCAL_SIZE**, for use in the inline assembler block of function prolog code. This symbol is used to allocate space for local variables on the stack frame in custom prolog code.  \n  \n The compiler determines the value of **__LOCAL_SIZE**. Its value is the total number of bytes of all user-defined local variables and compiler-generated temporary variables. **__LOCAL_SIZE** can be used only as an immediate operand; it cannot be used in an expression. You must not change or redefine the value of this symbol. For example:  \n  \n```  \nmov        eax, __LOCAL_SIZE           ;Immediate operand--Okay  \nmov        eax, [ebp - __LOCAL_SIZE]   ;Error  \n```  \n  \n The following example of a naked function containing custom prolog and epilog sequences uses the **__LOCAL_SIZE** symbol in the prolog sequence:  \n  \n```  \n// the__local_size_symbol.cpp  \n// processor: x86  \n__declspec ( naked ) int main() {  \n   int i;  \n   int j;  \n  \n   __asm {      /* prolog */  \n      push   ebp  \n      mov      ebp, esp  \n      sub      esp, __LOCAL_SIZE  \n      }  \n  \n   /* Function body */  \n   __asm {   /* epilog */  \n      mov      esp, ebp  \n      pop      ebp  \n      ret  \n      }  \n}  \n```  \n  \n### END Microsoft Specific  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Naked Function Calls](../cpp/naked-function-calls.md)"}
