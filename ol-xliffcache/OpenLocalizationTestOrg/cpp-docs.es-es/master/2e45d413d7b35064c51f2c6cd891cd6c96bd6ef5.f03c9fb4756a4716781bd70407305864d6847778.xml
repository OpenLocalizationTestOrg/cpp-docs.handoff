They are segregated into their own section of the /imports dumping and are explicitly labeled as delay-loaded imports. If there is unload information present in the image, that is noted. If there is bind information present, the time/date stamp of the target DLL is noted along with the bound addresses of the imports.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Linker Support for Delay-Loaded DLLs](../../build/reference/linker-support-for-delay-loaded-dlls.md)"}
