This is determined by the arguments you pass to the document-template constructor. The following code illustrates creation of a [CMultiDocTemplate](../mfc/reference/cmultidoctemplate-class.md) for a sample application:  \n  \n [!code-cpp[NVC_MFCDocView#7](../mfc/codesnippet/cpp/document-template-creation_1.cpp)]  \n  \n The pointer to a new `CMultiDocTemplate` object is used as an argument to [AddDocTemplate](../mfc/reference/cwinapp-class.md#cwinapp__adddoctemplate). Arguments to the `CMultiDocTemplate` constructor include the resource ID associated with the document type's menus and accelerators, and three uses of the [RUNTIME_CLASS](../mfc/reference/run-time-object-model-services.md#runtime_class) macro. `RUNTIME_CLASS` returns the [CRuntimeClass](../mfc/reference/cruntimeclass-structure.md) object for the C++ class named as its argument. The three `CRuntimeClass` objects passed to the document-template constructor supply the information needed to create new objects of the specified classes during the document creation process. The example shows creation of a document template that creates `CScribDoc` objects with `CScribView` objects attached. The views are framed by standard MDI child frame windows.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Document Templates and the Document/View Creation Process](../mfc/document-templates-and-the-document-view-creation-process.md)   \n [Document/View Creation](../mfc/document-view-creation.md)   \n [Relationships Among MFC Objects](../mfc/relationships-among-mfc-objects.md)   \n [Creating New Documents, Windows, and Views](../mfc/creating-new-documents-windows-and-views.md)\n\n"}
