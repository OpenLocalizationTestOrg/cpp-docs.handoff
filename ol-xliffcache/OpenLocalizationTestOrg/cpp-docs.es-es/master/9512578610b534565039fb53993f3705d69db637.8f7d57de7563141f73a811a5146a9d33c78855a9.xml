A property sheet, also known as a tab dialog box, provides a way to manage large numbers of controls in a dialog box. The property sheet contains property pages, each based on a separate dialog template resource. You can divide your dialog box's controls into logical groups and put each group on its own property page.  \n  \n## What do you want to know more about  \n  \n-   [Property sheets and property pages](../mfc/property-sheets-and-property-pages-in-mfc.md)  \n  \n-   [Using Property Sheets in Your Application](../mfc/using-property-sheets-in-your-application.md)  \n  \n-   [Adding Controls to a Property Sheet](../mfc/adding-controls-to-a-property-sheet.md) (as opposed to a property page)  \n  \n-   [Exchanging data between a property sheet and your program](../mfc/exchanging-data.md)  \n  \n-   [Creating a modeless property sheet](../mfc/creating-a-modeless-property-sheet.md)  \n  \n-   [Handling the Apply button](../mfc/handling-the-apply-button.md)  \n  \n-   [Property Sheets as Wizards](../mfc/property-sheets-as-wizards.md)  \n  \n-   [Class CPropertySheet](../mfc/reference/cpropertysheet-class.md)  \n  \n-   [Class CPropertyPage](../mfc/reference/cpropertypage-class.md)  \n  \n-   [Sample](../visual-cpp-samples.md)  \n  \n## See Also  \n [User Interface Elements](../mfc/user-interface-elements-mfc.md)\n"}
