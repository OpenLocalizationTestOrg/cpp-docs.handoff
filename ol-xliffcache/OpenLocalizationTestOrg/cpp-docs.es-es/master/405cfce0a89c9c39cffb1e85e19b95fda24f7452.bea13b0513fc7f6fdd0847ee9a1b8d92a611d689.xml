You may have intended to link as a DLL, in which case you should link with the [/DLL](../../build/reference/dll-build-a-dll.md) option. You may have also forgotten to specify the name of the entry point; link with the [/ENTRY](../../build/reference/entry-entry-point-symbol.md) option.  \n  \n Otherwise, you should include a main, wmain, WinMain, or wMain function in your code.  \n  \n If you are using [LIB](../../build/reference/lib-reference.md) and intend to build a .dll, one reason for this error is that you supplied a .def file. If so, remove the .def file from the build.  \n  \n The following sample generates LNK1561:  \n  \n```  \n// LNK1561.cpp  \n// LNK1561 expected  \nint i;  \n// add a main function to resolve this error  \n```"}
