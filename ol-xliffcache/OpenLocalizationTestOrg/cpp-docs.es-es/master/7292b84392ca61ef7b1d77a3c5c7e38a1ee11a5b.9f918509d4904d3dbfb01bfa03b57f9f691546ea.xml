Properties for ActiveX controls are displayed in the Properties window. In addition, any property pages created by the writers of the ActiveX control are displayed in the **Properties Pages** dialog box (to view the Property Page for a specific ActiveX control, click the Property Page button in the [Properties Window](/visualstudio/ide/reference/properties-window)).  \n  \n Various tabs are displayed in the property page for an ActiveX control, depending on the property sheets that come as part of the ActiveX control.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The following procedure applies to using the property page to edit ActiveX controls.
