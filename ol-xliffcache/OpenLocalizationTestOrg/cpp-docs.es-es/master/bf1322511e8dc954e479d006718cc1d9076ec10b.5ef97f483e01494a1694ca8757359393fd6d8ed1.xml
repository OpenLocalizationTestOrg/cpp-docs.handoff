The semantics of these directives are identical to that of explicitly specifying a **parallel** directive followed by a single work-sharing construct.  \n  \n The following sections describe the combined parallel work-sharing constructs:  \n  \n-   the **parallel for** directive.  \n  \n-   the **parallel sections** directive."}
