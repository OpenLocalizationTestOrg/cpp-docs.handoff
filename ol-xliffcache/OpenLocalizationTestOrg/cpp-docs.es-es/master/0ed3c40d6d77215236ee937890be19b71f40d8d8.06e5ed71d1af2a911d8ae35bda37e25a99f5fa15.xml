The format is as follows:  \n  \n```  \n#include <omp.h>  \nint omp_get_num_threads(void);  \n```  \n  \n The **num_threads** clause, the **omp_set_num_threads** function, and the **OMP_NUM_THREADS** environment variable control the number of threads in a team.  \n  \n If the number of threads has not been explicitly set by the user, the default is implementation-defined. This function binds to the closest enclosing **parallel** directive. If called from a serial portion of a program, or from a nested parallel region that is serialized, this function returns 1.  \n  \n## Cross References:  \n  \n-   **OMP_NUM_THREADS** environment variable, see [Section 4.2](../../parallel/openmp/4-2-omp-num-threads.md) on page 48.  \n  \n-   **num_threads** clause, see [Section 2.3](../../parallel/openmp/2-3-parallel-construct.md) on page 8.  \n  \n-   **parallel** construct, see [Section 2.3](../../parallel/openmp/2-3-parallel-construct.md) on page 8."}
