Because an error occurred, no object or executable file was generated.  \n  \n This error only appears when the **/WX** flag is set and a warning occurs during compilation. To fix this error, you must eliminate every warning in your project.  \n  \n### To fix, use one of the following techniques  \n  \n-   Fix the problems that cause warnings in your project.  \n  \n-   Compile at a lower warning level—for example, use **/W3** instead of **/W4**.  \n  \n-   Use a [warning](../../preprocessor/warning.md) pragma to disable or suppress a specific warning.  \n  \n-   Don't use **/WX** to compile."}
