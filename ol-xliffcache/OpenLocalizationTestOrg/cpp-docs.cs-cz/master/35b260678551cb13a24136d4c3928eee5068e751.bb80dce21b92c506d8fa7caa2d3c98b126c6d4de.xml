To change environment variables from the command line in Windows, use the SET command (for example, SET LIB = D:\\ LIBS).  \n  \n Environment variables set from within a C program exist only as long as their host copy of the operating system command shell is running (CMD.EXE or COMMAND.COM). For example, the line  \n  \n```  \nsystem( SET LIB = D:\\LIBS );  \n```  \n  \n would run a copy of the command shell (CMD.EXE), set the environment variable LIB, and return to the C program, exiting the secondary copy of CMD.EXE. Exiting that copy of CMD.EXE removes the temporary environment variable LIB.  \n  \n Likewise, changes made by the `_putenv` function last only until the program ends.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Library Functions](../c-language/library-functions.md)   \n [_putenv, _wputenv](../c-runtime-library/reference/putenv-wputenv.md)   \n [getenv, _wgetenv](../c-runtime-library/reference/getenv-wgetenv.md)"}
