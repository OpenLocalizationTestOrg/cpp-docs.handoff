Event declarations have been modified as well.  \n  \n Under the category of changes that have no Managed Extensions support, static constructors can now be defined out-of-line (they were required to be defined inline within Managed Extensions), and the notion of a delegating constructor has been introduced.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Property Declaration](../dotnet/property-declaration.md)  \n Discusses changes to property declarations.  \n  \n [Property Index Declaration](../dotnet/property-index-declaration.md)  \n Discusses changes to indexed property declarations.  \n  \n [Delegates and Events](../dotnet/delegates-and-events.md)  \n Discusses changes to the syntax for declaring delegates and events.  \n  \n [Sealing a Virtual Function](../dotnet/sealing-a-virtual-function.md)  \n Discusses changes to the syntax for sealing a function.  \n  \n [Overloaded Operators](../dotnet/overloaded-operators.md)  \n Discusses changes to operator overloading.  \n  \n [Changes to Conversion Operators](../dotnet/changes-to-conversion-operators.md)  \n Discusses changes to conversion operators.  \n  \n [Explicit Override of an Interface Member](../dotnet/explicit-override-of-an-interface-member.md)  \n Discusses changes to the method for explicitly overriding an interface member.  \n  \n [Private Virtual Functions](../dotnet/private-virtual-functions.md)  \n Discusses changes in the way private virtual functions are handled in derived classes.  \n  \n [Static Const Int Linkage Is No Longer Literal](../dotnet/static-const-int-linkage-is-no-longer-literal.md)  \n Discusses changes in the way `static const` integral members are linked and how to explicitly declare a constant using the new `literal` keyword.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [C++/CLI Migration Primer](../dotnet/cpp-cli-migration-primer.md)"}
