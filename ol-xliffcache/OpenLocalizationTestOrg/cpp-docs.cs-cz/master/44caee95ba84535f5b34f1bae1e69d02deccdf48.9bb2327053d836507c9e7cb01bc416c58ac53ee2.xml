To fix this error, give the event handler method the same calling conventions as those of the source event method. For example, in the code below, make the calling conventions of `handler1` and `event1` match ([__cdecl](../../cpp/cdecl.md) or [__stdcall](../../cpp/stdcall.md) or others). Removing calling convention keywords from both declarations will also solve the problem, and cause `event1` and `handler1` to default to the [thiscall](../../cpp/thiscall.md) calling convention. See [Calling Conventions](../../cpp/calling-conventions.md) for more information.  \n  \n The following sample generates C3714:  \n  \n```  \n// C3714.cpp  \n// compile with: /c  \n// processor: x86  \n[event_source(native)]  \nclass CEventSrc {  \npublic:  \n   __event void __cdecl event1();  \n   // try the following line instead  \n   // __event void __stdcall event1();  \n};  \n  \n[event_receiver(native)]  \nclass CEventRec {  \npublic:  \n   void __stdcall handler1() {}  \n  \n   void HookEvents(CEventSrc* pSrc) {  \n      __hook(&CEventSrc::event1, pSrc, &CEventRec::handler1);   // C3714  \n   }  \n  \n   void UnhookEvents(CEventSrc* pSrc) {  \n      __unhook(&CEventSrc::event1, pSrc, &CEventRec::handler1); // C3714  \n   }  \n};  \n```"}
