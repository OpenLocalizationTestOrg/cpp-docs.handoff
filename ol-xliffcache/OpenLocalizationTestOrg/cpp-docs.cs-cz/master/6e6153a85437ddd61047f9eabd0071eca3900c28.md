# Command-Line Warning D9026
options apply to entire command line  
  
 An option was specified on a command after a filename was specified. The option was applied to the file that preceded it.  
  
 For example, in the command  
  
```  
CL verdi.c /G5 puccini.c  
```  
  
 the file VERDI.c will be compiled using the /G5 option, not the /G4 default.  
  
 This behavior is different from that of some previous versions, which applied only the options specified before the filename, resulting in VERDI.c being compiled using /G4 and PUCCINI.c being compiled using /G5.
