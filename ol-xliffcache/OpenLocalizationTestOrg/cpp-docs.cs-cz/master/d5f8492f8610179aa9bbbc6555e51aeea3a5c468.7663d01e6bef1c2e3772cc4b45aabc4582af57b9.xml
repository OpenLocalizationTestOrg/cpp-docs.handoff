You can use the [Properties Window](/visualstudio/ide/reference/properties-window) to change the default symbol name or to change the name of any symbol already associated with a resource.  \n  \n### To change a resource's symbol name  \n  \n1.  In [Resource View](../windows/resource-view-window.md), select the resource.  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  If your project doesn't already contain an .rc file, please see [Creating a New Resource Script File](../windows/how-to-create-a-resource-script-file.md).  \n  \n2.  In the **Properties** window, type a new symbol name or select from the list of existing symbols in the **ID** box.  \n  \n     If you type a new symbol name, it is automatically assigned a value.  \n  \n You can use the [Resource Symbols dialog box](../windows/resource-symbols-dialog-box.md) to change the names of symbols not currently assigned to a resource. For more information, see [Changing Unassigned Symbols](../windows/changing-unassigned-symbols.md).  \n  \n For information on adding resources to managed projects, please see [Resources in Applications](http://msdn.microsoft.com/Library/8ad495d4-2941-40cf-bf64-e82e85825890) in the *.NET Framework Developer's Guide.* For information on manually adding resource files to managed projects, accessing resources, displaying static resources, and assigning resources strings to properties, see [Walkthrough: Using Resources for Localization with ASP.NET](http://msdn.microsoft.com/Library/bb4e5b44-e2b0-48ab-bbe9-609fb33900b6).  \n  \n Requirements  \n  \n Win32  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Symbol Name Restrictions](../windows/symbol-name-restrictions.md)   \n [Predefined Symbol IDs](../windows/predefined-symbol-ids.md)"}
