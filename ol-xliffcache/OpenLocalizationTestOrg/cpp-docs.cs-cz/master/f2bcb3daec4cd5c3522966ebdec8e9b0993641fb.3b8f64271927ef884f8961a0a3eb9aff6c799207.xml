The semantics are identical to explicitly specifying a **parallel** directive immediately followed by a **sections** directive. The syntax of the **parallel sections** directive is as follows:  \n  \n```  \n#pragma omp parallel sections  [clause[[,] clause] ...] new-line  \n   {  \n   [#pragma omp section new-line]  \n      structured-block  \n   [#pragma omp section new-linestructured-block  ]  \n   ...  \n}  \n```  \n  \n The *clause* can be one of the clauses accepted by the **parallel** and **sections** directives, except the **nowait** clause.  \n  \n## Cross References:  \n  \n-   **parallel** directive, see [Section 2.3](../../parallel/openmp/2-3-parallel-construct.md) on page 8.  \n  \n-   **sections** directive, see [Section 2.4.2](../../parallel/openmp/2-4-2-sections-construct.md) on page 14."}
