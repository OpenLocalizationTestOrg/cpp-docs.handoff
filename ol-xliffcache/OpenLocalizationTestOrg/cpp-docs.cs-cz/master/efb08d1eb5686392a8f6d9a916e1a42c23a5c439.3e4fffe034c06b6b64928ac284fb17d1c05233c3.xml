It is used by the Windows [CreateBrushIndirect](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd183487) and [ExtCreatePen](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd162705) functions.  \n  \n## Syntax  \n  \n```  \ntypedef struct tag LOGBRUSH { /* lb */  \n    UINT lbStyle;  \n    COLORREF lbColor;  \n    LONG lbHatch;  \n} LOGBRUSH;  \n```  \n  \n#### Parameters  \n `lbStyle`  \n Specifies the brush style. The `lbStyle` member must be one of the following styles:  \n  \n- **BS_DIBPATTERN** A pattern brush defined by a device-independent bitmap (DIB) specification. If `lbStyle` is **BS_DIBPATTERN**, the **lbHatch** member contains a handle to a packed DIB.  \n  \n- **BS_DIBPATTERNPT** A pattern brush defined by a device-independent bitmap (DIB) specification. If `lbStyle` is **BS_DIBPATTERNPT**, the **lbHatch** member contains a pointer to a packed DIB.  \n  \n- **BS_HATCHED** Hatched brush.  \n  \n- **BS_HOLLOW** Hollow brush.  \n  \n- **BS_NULL** Same as **BS_HOLLOW**.  \n  \n- **BS_PATTERN** Pattern brush defined by a memory bitmap.  \n  \n- **BS_SOLID** Solid brush.  \n  \n `lbColor`  \n Specifies the color in which the brush is to be drawn. If `lbStyle` is the **BS_HOLLOW** or **BS_PATTERN** style, **lbColor** is ignored. If `lbStyle` is **BS_DIBPATTERN** or **BS_DIBPATTERNBT**, the low-order word of **lbColor** specifies whether the **bmiColors** members of the [BITMAPINFO](../../mfc/reference/bitmapinfo-structure.md) structure contain explicit red, green, blue (RGB) values or indices into the currently realized logical palette. The **lbColor** member must be one of the following values:  \n  \n- **DIB_PAL_COLORS** The color table consists of an array of 16-bit indices into the currently realized logical palette.  \n  \n- **DIB_RGB_COLORS** The color table contains literal RGB values.  \n  \n *lbHatch*  \n Specifies a hatch style. The meaning depends on the brush style defined by `lbStyle`. If `lbStyle` is **BS_DIBPATTERN**, the **lbHatch** member contains a handle to a packed DIB. If `lbStyle` is **BS_DIBPATTERNPT**, the **lbHatch** member contains a pointer to a packed DIB. If `lbStyle` is **BS_HATCHED**, the **lbHatch** member specifies the orientation of the lines used to create the hatch. It can be one of the following values:  \n  \n- `HS_BDIAGONAL` A 45-degree upward, left-to-right hatch  \n  \n- `HS_CROSS` Horizontal and vertical crosshatch  \n  \n- `HS_DIAGCROSS` 45-degree crosshatch  \n  \n- `HS_FDIAGONAL` A 45-degree downward, left-to-right hatch  \n  \n- `HS_HORIZONTAL` Horizontal hatch  \n  \n- `HS_VERTICAL` Vertical hatch  \n  \n If `lbStyle` is **BS_PATTERN**, **lbHatch** is a handle to the bitmap that defines the pattern. If `lbStyle` is **BS_SOLID** or **BS_HOLLOW**, **lbHatch** is ignored.  \n  \n## Remarks  \n Although **lbColor** controls the foreground color of a hatch brush, the [CDC::SetBkMode](../../mfc/reference/cdc-class.md#cdc__setbkmode) and [CDC::SetBkColor](../../mfc/reference/cdc-class.md#cdc__setbkcolor) functions control the background color.  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Header:** wingdi.h  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Structures, Styles, Callbacks, and Message Maps](../../mfc/reference/structures-styles-callbacks-and-message-maps.md)   \n [CDC::GetCharABCWidths](../../mfc/reference/cdc-class.md#cdc__getcharabcwidths)\n\n"}
