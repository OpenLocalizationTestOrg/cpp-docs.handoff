# 2.5 Combined Parallel Work-sharing Constructs
Combined parallel workâ€“sharing constructs are shortcuts for specifying a parallel region that contains only one work-sharing construct. The semantics of these directives are identical to that of explicitly specifying a **parallel** directive followed by a single work-sharing construct.  
  
 The following sections describe the combined parallel work-sharing constructs:  
  
-   the **parallel for** directive.  
  
-   the **parallel sections** directive.
