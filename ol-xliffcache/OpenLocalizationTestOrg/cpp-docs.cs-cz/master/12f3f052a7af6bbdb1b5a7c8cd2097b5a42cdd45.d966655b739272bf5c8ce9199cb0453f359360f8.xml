For a checklist summary of syntactic changes, see [(NOTINBUILD)Managed Extensions for C++ Syntax Upgrade Checklist](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/edbded88-7ef3-4757-bd9d-b8f48ac2aada).  \n  \n C++/CLI extends a dynamic component programming paradigm to the ISO-C++ standard language. The new language offers a number of significant improvements over Managed Extensions. This section provides an enumerated listing of the Managed Extensions for C++ language features and their mapping to [!INCLUDE[cpp_current_long](../dotnet/includes/cpp_current_long_md.md)] where such a mapping exists, and points out those constructs for which no mapping exists.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Outline of Changes (C++/CLI)](../dotnet/outline-of-changes-cpp-cli.md)  \n A high-level outline for quick reference, providing a listing of the changes under five general categories.  \n  \n [Language Keywords (C++/CLI)](../dotnet/language-keywords-cpp-cli.md)  \n Discusses changes in language keywords, including the removal of the double underscore and the introduction of both contextual and spaced keywords.  \n  \n [Managed Types (C++/CL)](../dotnet/managed-types-cpp-cl.md)  \n Looks at syntactic changes in the declaration of the Common Type System (CTS) – this includes changes in the declaration of classes, arrays (including the parameter array), enums, and so on.  \n  \n [Member Declarations within a Class or Interface (C++/CLI)](../dotnet/member-declarations-within-a-class-or-interface-cpp-cli.md)  \n Presents the changes involving class members such as scalar properties, index properties, operators, delegates, and events.  \n  \n [Value Types and Their Behaviors (C++/CLI)](../dotnet/value-types-and-their-behaviors-cpp-cli.md)  \n Focuses on value types and the new family of interior and pinning pointers. It also discusses a number of significant semantics changes such as the introduction of implicit boxing, immutability of boxed value types, and the removal of support for default constructors within value classes.  \n  \n [General Language Changes (C++/CLI)](../dotnet/general-language-changes-cpp-cli.md)  \n Details semantic changes such as support for cast notation, string literal behavior, and changes in the semantics between ISO-C++ and C++/CLI.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Mixed (Native and Managed) Assemblies](../dotnet/mixed-native-and-managed-assemblies.md)   \n [Component Extensions for Runtime Platforms](../windows/component-extensions-for-runtime-platforms.md)"}
