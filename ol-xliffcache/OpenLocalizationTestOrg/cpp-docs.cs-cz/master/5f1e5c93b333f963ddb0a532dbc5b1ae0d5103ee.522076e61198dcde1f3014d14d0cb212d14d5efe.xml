It is equivalent to specifying **/source-charset:utf-8 /execution-charset:utf-8** on the command line. Any of these options also enables the **/validate-charset** option by default. For a list of supported code page identifiers and character set names, see [Code Page Identifiers](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/5d6fc86a-f205-4d14-bb7c-ecd71682e0fe).  \n  \n By default, Visual Studio detects a byte-order mark to determine if the source file is in an encoded Unicode format, for example, UTF-16 or UTF-8. If no byte-order mark is found, it assumes the source file is encoded using the current user code page, unless you have specified a code page by using **/utf-8** or the **/source-charset** option. Visual Studio allows you to save your C++ source code by using any of several character encodings. For information about source and execution character sets, see [Character Sets](../../cpp/character-sets2.md) in the language documentation.  \n  \n### To set this compiler option in the Visual Studio development environment  \n  \n1.  Open the project **Property Pages** dialog box. For more information, see [Working with Project Properties](../../ide/working-with-project-properties.md).  \n  \n2.  Expand the **Configuration Properties**, **C/C++**, **Command Line** folder.  \n  \n3.  In **Advanced Options**, add the **/utf-8** option, and specify your preferred encoding.  \n  \n4.  Choose **OK** to save your changes.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Compiler Options](../../build/reference/compiler-options.md)   \n [Setting Compiler Options](../../build/reference/setting-compiler-options.md)   \n [/execution-charset (Set Execution Character Set)](../../build/reference/execution-charset-set-execution-character-set.md)   \n [/source-charset (Set Source Character Set)](../../build/reference/source-charset-set-source-character-set.md)   \n [/validate-charset (Validate for compatible characters)](../../build/reference/validate-charset-validate-for-compatible-characters.md)"}
