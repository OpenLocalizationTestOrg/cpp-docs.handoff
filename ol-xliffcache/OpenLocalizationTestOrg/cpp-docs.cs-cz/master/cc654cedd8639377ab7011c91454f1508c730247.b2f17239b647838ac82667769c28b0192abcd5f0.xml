Enables seamless use of D3D resources for compute in AMP code and the use of resources created in AMP in D3D code, without creating redundant intermediate copies. You can use C++ AMP to incrementally accelerate the compute-intensive sections of your DirectX applications and use the D3D API on data produced from AMP computations.  \n  \n [Concurrency::fast_math Namespace](concurrency-fast-math-namespace.md)  \n Functions in the `fast_math` namespace are not C99-compliant. Only single-precision versions of each function are provided. These functions use the DirectX intrinsic functions, which are faster than the corresponding functions in the `precise_math` namespace and do not require extended double-precision support on the accelerator, but they are less accurate. There are two versions of each function for source-level compatibility with C99 code; both versions take and return single-precision values.  \n  \n [Concurrency::graphics Namespace](concurrency-graphics-namespace.md)  \n Provides types and functions that are designed for graphics programming.  \n  \n [Concurrency::precise_math Namespace](concurrency-precise-math-namespace.md)  \n Functions in the `precise_math` namespace are C99 compliant. Both single-precision and double-precision versions of each function are included. These functions—this includes the single-precision functions—require extended double-precision support on the accelerator.  \n  \n## Related Sections  \n [C++ AMP (C++ Accelerated Massive Parallelism)](../../../parallel/amp/cpp-amp-cpp-accelerated-massive-parallelism.md)  \n C++ AMP accelerates the execution of your C++ code by taking advantage of the data-parallel hardware that's commonly present as a graphics processing unit (GPU) on a discrete graphics card.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
