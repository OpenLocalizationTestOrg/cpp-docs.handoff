An outgoing interface allows the object to communicate with a client. For each outgoing interface, the connectable object exposes a connection point. Each outgoing interface is implemented by a client on an object called a sink.  \n  \n ![Connection points](../atl/media/vc2zw31.gif \"vc2zw31\")  \n  \n Each connection point supports the [IConnectionPoint](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms694318) interface. The connectable object exposes its connection points to the client through the [IConnectionPointContainer](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms683857) interface.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [ATL Connection Point Classes](../atl/atl-connection-point-classes.md)  \n Briefly describes the ATL classes that support connection points.  \n  \n [Adding Connection Points to an Object](../atl/adding-connection-points-to-an-object.md)  \n Outlines the steps used to add connection points to an object.  \n  \n [ATL Connection Point Example](../atl/atl-connection-point-example.md)  \n Provides an example of declaring a connection point.  \n  \n## Related Sections  \n [ATL](../atl/active-template-library-atl-concepts.md)  \n Provides links to conceptual topics on how to program using the Active Template Library.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Concepts](../atl/active-template-library-atl-concepts.md)\n\n"}
