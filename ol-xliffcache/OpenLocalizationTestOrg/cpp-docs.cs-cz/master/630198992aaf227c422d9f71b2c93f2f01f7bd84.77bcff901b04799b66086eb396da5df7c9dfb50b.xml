For more information, see [Character Sets](../../cpp/character-sets2.md). In code compiled as C, you cannot use a universal character name for characters in the range 0x20-0x7f, inclusive, except for 0x24 ('$'), 0x40 ('@'), or 0x60 ('`').  \n  \n The following samples generate C3851, and show how to fix it:  \n  \n```cpp  \n// C3851.cpp  \nint main()  \n{  \n   int test1_\\u0041 = 0;   // C3851, \\u0041 = 'A' in basic character set  \n   int test2_A = 0;        // OK  \n}  \n```"}
