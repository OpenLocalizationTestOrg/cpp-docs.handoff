`CGopherFile`, `CGopherFileFind`, `CGopherLocator` and their members have been deprecated because they do not work on the Windows XP platform, but they will continue to work on earlier platforms.  \n

\n|[CGopherFile::CGopherFile](#cgopherfile__cgopherfile)|Constructs a `CGopherFile` object.|  \n  \n## Remarks  \n The gopher service does not allow users to write data to a gopher file because this service functions mainly as a menu-driven interface for finding information. The `CGopherFile` member functions **Write**, `WriteString`, and `Flush` are not implemented for `CGopherFile`. Calling these functions on a `CGopherFile` object, returns a [CNotSupportedException](../../mfc/reference/cnotsupportedexception-class.md).  \n  \n To learn more about how `CGopherFile` works with the other MFC Internet classes, see the article [Internet Programming with WinInet](../../mfc/win32-internet-extensions-wininet.md).  \n  \n## Inheritance Hierarchy  \n [CObject](../../mfc/reference/cobject-class.md)  \n  \n [CFile](../../mfc/reference/cfile-class.md)  \n  \n [CStdioFile](../../mfc/reference/cstdiofile-class.md)  \n  \n [CInternetFile](../../mfc/reference/cinternetfile-class.md)  \n  \n `CGopherFile`  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Header:** afxinet.h  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cgopherfile__cgopherfile\"></a>  CGopherFile::CGopherFile  \n This member function is called to construct a `CGopherFile` object.  \n  \n```  \nCGopherFile(\n    HINTERNET hFile,  \n    CGopherLocator& refLocator,  \n    CGopherConnection* pConnection);\n\n \nCGopherFile(\n    HINTERNET hFile,  \n    HINTERNET hSession,  \n    LPCTSTR pstrLocator,  \n    DWORD dwLocLen,  \n    DWORD_PTR dwContext);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `hFile`  \n A handle to an `HINTERNET` file.  \n  \n `refLocator`  \n A reference to a [CGopherLocator](../../mfc/reference/cgopherlocator-class.md) object.  \n  \n `pConnection`  \n A pointer to a [CGopherConnection](../../mfc/reference/cgopherconnection-class.md) object.  \n  \n `hSession`  \n A handle to the current Internet session.  \n  \n `pstrLocator`  \n A pointer to a string used to locate the gopher server.
