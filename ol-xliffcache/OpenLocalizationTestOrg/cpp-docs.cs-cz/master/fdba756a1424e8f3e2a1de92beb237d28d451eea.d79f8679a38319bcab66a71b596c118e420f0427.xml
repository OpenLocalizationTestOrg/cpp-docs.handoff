The difference between **exit** and **abort** is that **exit** allows the C++ run-time termination processing to take place (global object destructors will be called), whereas **abort** terminates the program immediately. For more information, see [abort](../c-runtime-library/reference/abort.md) in the *Run-Time Library Reference*.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Program Termination](../cpp/program-termination.md)"}
