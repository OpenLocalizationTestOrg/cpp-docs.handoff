The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.OnPaint%2A> function is intended for a Windows Forms application, most likely created with a Visual Studio application wizard.  \n  \n The image is represented by the <xref:System.Drawing.Image> class. The image data is loaded from a .jpg file using the <xref:System.Drawing.Image.FromFile%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method. Before the image is drawn to the form, the form is resized to accommodate the image. The drawing of the image is performed with the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawImage%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method.  \n  \n The <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> and <xref:System.Drawing.Image> classes are both in the <xref:System.Drawing?displayProperty=fullName> namespace.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  GDI+ is included with Windows XP and is available as a redistributable for Windows NT 4.0 SP 6, Windows 2000, Windows 98, and Windows Me.
