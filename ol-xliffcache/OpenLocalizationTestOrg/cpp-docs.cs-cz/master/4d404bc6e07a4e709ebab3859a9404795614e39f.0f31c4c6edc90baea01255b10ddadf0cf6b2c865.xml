In this case, 64-bit configurations will not be available. To fix this issue, run the installer for Visual Studio and install the missing C++ components.  \n  \n This error can also occur if you change the **Active solution configuration** in the **Configuration Manager** and then try to build the project before you delete the intermediate project files. To resolve this error, select **Rebuild Solution** from the **Build** menu. You can also select **Clean Solution** from the **Build** menu and then build the solution.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Linker Tools Errors and Warnings](../../error-messages/tool-errors/linker-tools-errors-and-warnings.md)"}
