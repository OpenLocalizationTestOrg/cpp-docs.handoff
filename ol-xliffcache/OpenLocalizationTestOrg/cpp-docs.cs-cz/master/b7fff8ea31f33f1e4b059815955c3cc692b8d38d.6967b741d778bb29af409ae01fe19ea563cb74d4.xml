You can also create a new bitmap patterned after a [template](../windows/how-to-use-resource-templates.md).  \n  \n### To add a new image resource to an unmanaged C++ project  \n  \n1.  In [Resource View](../windows/resource-view-window.md), right-click your .rc file, then choose **Insert Resource** from the shortcut menu. (If you already have an existing image resource in your .rc file, such as a cursor, you can simply right-click the **Cursor** folder and select **Insert Cursor** from the shortcut menu.)  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  **Note** If your project doesn't already contain an .rc file, please see [Creating a New Resource Script File](../windows/how-to-create-a-resource-script-file.md).  \n  \n2.  In the [Insert Resource dialog box](../windows/add-resource-dialog-box.md), select the type of image resource you'd like to create (**Bitmap**, for example) then click **New**.  \n  \n     If a plus sign (**+**) appears next to the image resource type in the **Insert Resource** dialog box, it means that toolbar templates are available. Click the plus sign to expand the list of templates, select a template, and click **New**.  \n  \n### To add a new image resource to a project in a .NET programming language  \n  \n1.  In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the project folder (for example, **WindowsApplication1**).  \n  \n2.  From the shortcut menu, click **Add**, then choose **Add New Item**.  \n  \n3.  In the **Categories** pane, expand the **Local Project Items** folder, then choose **Resources**.  \n  \n4.  In the **Templates** pane, choose the resource type you'd like to add to your project.  \n  \n     The resource is added to your project in Solution Explorer and the resource opens in the [Image editor](../mfc/image-editor-for-icons.md). You can now use all the tools available in the Image editor to modify your image.
