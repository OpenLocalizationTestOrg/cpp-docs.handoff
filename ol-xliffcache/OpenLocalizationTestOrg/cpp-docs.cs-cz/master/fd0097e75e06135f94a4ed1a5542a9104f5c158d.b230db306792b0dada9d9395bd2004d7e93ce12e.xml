The resulting pointer value is the address of `x[8]`.  \n  \n```  \nj = &x[i] - &x[i-2];  \n```  \n  \n In this example, the address of the third element of `x` (given by `x[i–2]`) is subtracted from the address of the fifth element of `x` (given by `x[i]`). The difference is divided by the length of a **float**; the result is the integer value 2.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [C Additive Operators](../c-language/c-additive-operators.md)"}
