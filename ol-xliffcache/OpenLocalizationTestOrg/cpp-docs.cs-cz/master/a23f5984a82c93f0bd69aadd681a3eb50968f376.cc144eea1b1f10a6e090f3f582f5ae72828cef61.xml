When you compile and link an image by using one invocation of cl.exe, **/hotpatch** implies **/functionpadmin**.  \n  \n Because instructions are always two bytes or larger on the ARM architecture, and because x64 compilation is always treated as if **/hotpatch** has been specified, you don't have to specify **/hotpatch** when you compile for these targets; however, you must still link by using **/functionpadmin** to create hotpatchable images for them. The **/hotpatch** compiler option only affects x86 compilation.  \n  \n### To set this compiler option in the Visual Studio development environment  \n  \n1.  Open the project's **Property Pages** dialog box. For details, see [Working with Project Properties](../../ide/working-with-project-properties.md).  \n  \n2.  Select the **C/C++** folder.  \n  \n3.  Select the **Command Line** property page.  \n  \n4.  Add the compiler option to the **Additional Options** box.  \n  \n### To set this compiler option programmatically  \n  \n-   See <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.VCProjectEngine.VCCLCompilerTool.AdditionalOptions%2A>.  \n  \n## Guidance  \n For more information about update management, see \"Security Guidance for Update Management\" at [http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/guidance/PatchManagement.mspx](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/guidance/PatchManagement.mspx).  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Compiler Options](../../build/reference/compiler-options.md)   \n [Setting Compiler Options](../../build/reference/setting-compiler-options.md)"}
