\n  \n Several methods in the Standard C++ Library have been identified as potentially unsafe because they could lead to a buffer overrun or other code defect. The use of these methods is discouraged, and new, more secure methods have been created to replace them. These new methods all end in `_s`.  \n  \n Several enhancements have also been made to make iterators and algorithms more secure. For more information, see [Checked Iterators](../standard-library/checked-iterators.md), [Debug Iterator Support](../standard-library/debug-iterator-support.md) and [_ITERATOR_DEBUG_LEVEL](../standard-library/iterator-debug-level.md).  \n  \n## Remarks  \n The following table lists the Standard C++ Library methods that are potentially unsafe, as well as their safer equivalent:  \n  \n|Potentially unsafe method|Safer equivalent|  \n|-------------------------------|----------------------|  \n|[basic_string::copy](../standard-library/basic-string-class.md#basic_string__copy)|[basic_string::_Copy_s](../standard-library/basic-string-class.md#basic_string___copy_s)|  \n|[char_traits::copy](../standard-library/char-traits-struct.md#char_traits__copy)|[char_traits::_Copy_s](../standard-library/char-traits-struct.md#char_traits___copy_s)|  \n  \n If you call any one of the potentially unsafe methods above, or if you use iterators incorrectly, the compiler will generate [Compiler Warning (level 3) C4996](../error-messages/compiler-warnings/compiler-warning-level-3-c4996.md).
