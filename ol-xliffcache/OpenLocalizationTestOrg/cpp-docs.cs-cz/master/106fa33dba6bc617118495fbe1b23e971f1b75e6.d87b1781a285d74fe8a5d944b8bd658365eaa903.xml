It is formed by combining one or more constants with a translation-mode constant.  \n  \n The file constants are as follows:  \n  \n `_O_APPEND`  \n Repositions the file pointer to the end of the file before every write operation.  \n  \n `_O_CREAT`  \n Creates and opens a new file for writing; this has no effect if the file specified by *filename* exists.  \n  \n `_O_EXCL`  \n Returns an error value if the file specified by *filename* exists. Only applies when used with `_O_CREAT`.  \n  \n `_O_RDONLY`  \n Opens file for reading only; if this flag is given, neither `_O_RDWR` nor `_O_WRONLY` can be given.  \n  \n `_O_RDWR`  \n Opens file for both reading and writing; if this flag is given, neither `_O_RDONLY` nor `_O_WRONLY` can be given.  \n  \n `_O_TRUNC`  \n Opens and truncates an existing file to zero length; the file must have write permission. The contents of the file are destroyed. If this flag is given, you cannot specify `_O_RDONLY`.  \n  \n `_O_WRONLY`  \n Opens file for writing only; if this flag is given, neither `_O_RDONLY` nor `_O_RDWR` can be given.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [_open, _wopen](../c-runtime-library/reference/open-wopen.md)   \n [_sopen, _wsopen](../c-runtime-library/reference/sopen-wsopen.md)   \n [Global Constants](../c-runtime-library/global-constants.md)"}
