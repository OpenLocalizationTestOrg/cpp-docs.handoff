Consequently, for an application that targets an Itanium Processor Family (IPF) computer, the compiler generates code that reads the unaligned data one byte at a time.  \n  \n## Remarks  \n The `__unaligned` modifier is valid for the [!INCLUDE[vcprx64](../assembler/inline/includes/vcprx64_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[vcpritanium](../cpp/includes/vcpritanium_md.md)] compilers but affects only applications that target an IPF computer. This modifier describes the alignment of the addressed data only; the pointer itself is assumed to be aligned.  \n  \n The [!INCLUDE[vcpritanium](../cpp/includes/vcpritanium_md.md)] processor generates an alignment fault when it accesses misaligned data, and the time to process the fault weakens performance. Use the `__unaligned` modifier to cause the processor to read data one byte at a time and avoid the fault. This modifier is not required for [!INCLUDE[vcprx64](../assembler/inline/includes/vcprx64_md.md)] applications because the [!INCLUDE[vcprx64](../assembler/inline/includes/vcprx64_md.md)] processor handles misaligned data without faulting.  \n  \n For more information about alignment, see:  \n  \n-   [align](../cpp/align-cpp.md)  \n  \n-   [__alignof Operator](../cpp/alignof-operator.md)  \n  \n-   [pack](../preprocessor/pack.md)  \n  \n-   [/Zp (Struct Member Alignment)](../build/reference/zp-struct-member-alignment.md)  \n  \n-   [Examples of Structure Alignment](../build/examples-of-structure-alignment.md)  \n  \n## Example  \n  \n```  \n// unaligned_keyword.cpp  \n// compile with: /c  \n// processor: x64 IPF  \n#include <stdio.h>  \nint main() {  \n   char buf[100];  \n  \n   int __unaligned *p1 = (int*)(&buf[37]);  \n   int *p2 = (int *)p1;  \n  \n   *p1 = 0;   // ok  \n  \n   __try {  \n      *p2 = 0;  // throws an exception  \n   }  \n   __except(1) {  \n      puts(\"exception\");  \n   }  \n}  \n```  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Keywords](../cpp/keywords-cpp.md)"}
