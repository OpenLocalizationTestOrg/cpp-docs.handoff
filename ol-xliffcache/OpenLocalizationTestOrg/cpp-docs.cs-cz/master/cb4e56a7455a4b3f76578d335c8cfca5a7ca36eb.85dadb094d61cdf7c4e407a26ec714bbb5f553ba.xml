That happens if the derived constructor/destructor is operating on a sub-object of some further derived object.  If the derived class named in the warning is never further derived, the warning can be ignored.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following sample generates C4436 and demonstrates the code generation issue that arises from the missing `vtordisp` field.  \n  \n```cpp  \n// C4436.cpp  \n// To see the warning and runtime assert, compile with: /W1  \n// To eliminate the warning and assert, compile with: /W1 /vd2  \n//       or compile with: /W1 /DFIX  \n#include <cassert>  \n  \nstruct A  \n{  \npublic:  \n    virtual ~A() {}  \n};  \n  \n#if defined(FIX)  \n#pragma vtordisp(push, 2)  \n#endif  \nstruct B : virtual A  \n{  \n    B()  \n    {  \n        A* a = static_cast<A*>(this);  \n        B* b = dynamic_cast<B*>(a);     // C4436  \n        assert(this == b);              // assert unless compiled with /vd2  \n    }  \n};  \n#if defined(FIX)  \n#pragma vtordisp(pop)  \n#endif  \n  \nstruct C : B  \n{  \n    int i;  \n};  \n  \nint main()  \n{  \n    C c;  \n}  \n```  \n  \n## See Also  \n [dynamic_cast Operator](../../cpp/dynamic-cast-operator.md)   \n [vtordisp](../../preprocessor/vtordisp.md)   \n [Compiler Warning (level 4) C4437](../../error-messages/compiler-warnings/compiler-warning-level-4-c4437.md)"}
