atomic_compare_exchange_strong  \n Performs an atomic compare and exchange operation.  \n  \n```\ntemplate <class Ty>\ninline bool atomic_compare_exchange_strong(\n    volatile atomic<Ty>* Atom,\n    Ty* Exp,\n    Value) noexcept;\n\ntemplate <class Ty>\ninline bool atomic_compare_exchange_strong(\n    atomic<Ty>* Atom,\n    Ty* Exp,\n    Ty Value) noexcept;\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `Atom`  \n A pointer to an `atomic` object that stores a value of type `Ty`.  \n  \n `Exp`  \n A pointer to a value of type `Ty`.  \n  \n `Value`  \n A value of type `Ty`.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n A `bool` that indicates the result of the value comparison.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n This method performs an atomic compare and exchange operation by using implicit `memory_order_seq_cst`[memory_order](../standard-library/atomic-enums.md#memory_order_enum) arguments. For more information, see [atomic_compare_exchange_strong_explicit](../standard-library/atomic-functions.md#atomic_compare_exchange_strong_explicit_function).  \n  \n##  <a name=\"atomic_compare_exchange_strong_explicit_function\"></a>  atomic_compare_exchange_strong_explicit  \n Performs an *atomic compare and exchange* operation.  \n  \n```\ntemplate <class T>\ninline bool atomic_compare_exchange_strong_explicit(\n    volatile atomic<Ty>* Atom,\n    Ty* Exp,\n    Ty Value,\n    memory_order Order1,\n    memory_order Order2) noexcept;\n\ntemplate <class Ty>\ninline bool atomic_compare_exchange_strong_explicit(\n    atomic<Ty>* Atom,\n    Ty* Exp,\n    Ty Value,\n    memory_order Order1,\n    memory_order Order2) noexcept;\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `Atom`  \n A pointer to an `atomic` object that stores a value of type `Ty`.  \n  \n `Exp`  \n A pointer to a value of type `Ty`.  \n  \n `Value`  \n A value of type `Ty`.  \n  \n `Order1`  \n First [memory_order](../standard-library/atomic-enums.md#memory_order_enum) argument.  \n  \n `Order2`  \n Second `memory_order` argument.

If the values are equal,\n    The the value that is stored in the object that is pointed to by `atom` is replaced with `Val` by using a `read-modify-write` operation and applying the memory order constraints that are specified by `Order1`. If the values are not equal,\n    The operation replaces the value that is pointed to by `Exp` with the value that is stored in the object that is pointed to by `Atom` and applies the memory order constraints that are specified by `Order2`.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"atomic_compare_exchange_weak_function\"></a>  atomic_compare_exchange_weak  \n Performs a *weak atomic compare and exchange* operation.  \n  \n```\ntemplate <class Ty>\ninline bool atomic_compare_exchange_strong(\n    volatile atomic<Ty>* Atom,\n    Ty* Exp,\n    Ty Value) noexcept;\n\ntemplate <class Ty>\ninline bool atomic_compare_exchange_strong(\n    atomic<Ty>* Atom,\n    Ty* Exp,\n    Ty Value) noexcept;\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `Atom`  \n A pointer to an `atomic` object that stores a value of type `Ty`.  \n  \n `Exp`  \n A pointer to a value of type `Ty`.  \n  \n `Value`  \n A value of type `Ty`.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n A `bool` that indicates the result of the value comparison.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n This method performs a *weak atomic compare and exchange operation* that has implicit `memory_order_seq_cst`[memory_order](../standard-library/atomic-enums.md#memory_order_enum) arguments.

If the values are equal, the operation replaces the value that is stored in the object that is pointed to by `Atom` with `Val` by using a `read-modify-write` operation and applying the memory-order constraints that are specified by `Order1`. If the values are not equal, the operation replaces the value that is pointed to by `Exp` with the value that is stored in the object that is pointed to by `Atom` and applies the memory-order constraints that are specified by `Order2`.  \n  \n A *weak* atomic compare and exchange operation performs an exchange if the compared values are equal.
