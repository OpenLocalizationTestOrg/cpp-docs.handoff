For more information, see [STL Containers](../standard-library/stl-containers.md).  \n  \n Describes an object that can serve as a reference to an element of the controlled sequence.  \n  \n## Syntax  \n  \n```  \n \ntypedef T2 reference;  \n```  \n  \n## Remarks  \n It is described here as a synonym for the unspecified type **T2** (typically **Alloc::reference**). An object of type **reference** can be cast to an object of type [const_reference](../standard-library/container-class-const-reference.md).  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Sample Container Class](../standard-library/sample-container-class.md)\n"}
