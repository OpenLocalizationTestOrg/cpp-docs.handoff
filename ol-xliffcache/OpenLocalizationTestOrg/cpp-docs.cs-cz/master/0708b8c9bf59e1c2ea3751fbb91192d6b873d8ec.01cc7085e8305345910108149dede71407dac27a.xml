Static class constructors are called by the common language runtime to do class initialization, initializing static data members.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following sample generates C3836:  \n  \n```  \n// C3836a.cpp  \n// compile with: /clr  \nref class M  \n{  \n   static int s_i;  \n  \npublic:  \n   static M() :  s_i(1234)   // C3836, delete initializer to resolve  \n   {  \n   }  \n};  \n  \nint main()  \n{  \n}  \n```  \n"}
