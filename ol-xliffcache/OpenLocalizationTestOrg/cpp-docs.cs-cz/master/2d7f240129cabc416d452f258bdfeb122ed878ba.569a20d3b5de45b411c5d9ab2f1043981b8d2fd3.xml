You can drag the sizing handles to change the size of all or part of an image. Sizing handles that you can drag are solid. You cannot drag handles that are hollow. You can use the Properties window to resize the entire image only, not a selected part.  \n  \n ![Sizing handles on a bitmap](../mfc/media/vcimageeditorsizinghandles.gif \"vcImageEditorSizingHandles\")  \nSizing Handles  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  If you have the Tile Grid option selected in the [Grid Settings dialog box](../mfc/grid-settings-dialog-box-image-editor-for-icons.md), then resizing snaps to the next tile grid line.
