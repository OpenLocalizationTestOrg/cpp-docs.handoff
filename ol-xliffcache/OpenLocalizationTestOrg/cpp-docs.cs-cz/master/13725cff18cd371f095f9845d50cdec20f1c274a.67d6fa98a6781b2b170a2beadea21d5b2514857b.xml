localeconv\nGets detailed information on locale settings.  \n  \n## Syntax  \n  \n```  \n  \nstruct lconv *localeconv( void );  \n```  \n  \n## Return Value  \n `localeconv` returns a pointer to a filled-in object of type [struct lconv](../../c-runtime-library/standard-types.md). The values contained in the object can be overwritten by subsequent calls to `localeconv` and do not directly modify the object. Calls to [setlocale](../../c-runtime-library/reference/setlocale-wsetlocale.md) with `category` values of `LC_ALL`, `LC_MONETARY`, or `LC_NUMERIC` overwrite the contents of the structure.  \n  \n## Remarks  \n The `localeconv` function gets detailed information about numeric formatting for the current locale. This information is stored in a structure of type **lconv**. The **lconv** structure, defined in LOCALE.H, contains the following members:  \n  \n `char *decimal_point, wchar_t *_W_decimal_point`  \n Decimal-point character for nonmonetary quantities.  \n  \n `char *thousands_sep, wchar_t *_W_thousands_sep`  \n Character that separates groups of digits to left of decimal point for nonmonetary quantities.  \n  \n `char *grouping`  \n Size of each group of digits in nonmonetary quantities.  \n  \n `char *int_curr_symbol, wchar_t *_W_int_curr_symbol`  \n International currency symbol for current locale. First three characters specify alphabetic international currency symbol as defined in the *ISO 4217 Codes for the Representation of Currency and Funds* standard. Fourth character (immediately preceding null character) separates international currency symbol from monetary quantity.  \n  \n `char *currency_symbol, wchar_t *_W_currency_symbol`  \n Local currency symbol for current locale.  \n  \n `char *mon_decimal_point, wchar_t *_W_mon_decimal_point`  \n Decimal-point character for monetary quantities.  \n  \n `char *mon_thousands_sep, wchar_t *_W_mon_thousands_sep`  \n Separator for groups of digits to left of decimal place in monetary quantities.  \n  \n `char *mon_grouping`  \n Size of each group of digits in monetary quantities.  \n  \n `char *positive_sign, wchar_t *_W_positive_sign`  \n String denoting sign for nonnegative monetary quantities.  \n  \n `char *negative_sign, wchar_t *_W_negative_sign`  \n String denoting sign for negative monetary quantities.  \n  \n `char int_frac_digits`  \n Number of digits to right of decimal point in internationally formatted monetary quantities.  \n  \n `char frac_digits`  \n Number of digits to right of decimal point in formatted monetary quantities.  \n  \n `char p_cs_precedes`  \n Set to 1 if currency symbol precedes value for nonnegative formatted monetary quantity. Set to 0 if symbol follows value.  \n  \n `char p_sep_by_space`  \n Set to 1 if currency symbol is separated by space from value for nonnegative formatted monetary quantity. Set to 0 if there is no space separation.  \n  \n `char n_cs_precedes`  \n Set to 1 if currency symbol precedes value for negative formatted monetary quantity. Set to 0 if symbol succeeds value.  \n  \n `char n_sep_by_space`  \n Set to 1 if currency symbol is separated by space from value for negative formatted monetary quantity. Set to 0 if there is no space separation.  \n  \n `char p_sign_posn`  \n Position of positive sign in nonnegative formatted monetary quantities.  \n  \n `char n_sign_posn`  \n Position of positive sign in negative formatted monetary quantities.  \n  \n Members of the structure that have `char` `*` and `wchar_t *` versions are pointers to strings. Any of these that equals `\"\"` (or `L\"\"` for `wchar_t *`) is either of zero length or not supported in the current locale. Note that `decimal_point` and `_W_decimal_point` are always supported and of nonzero length.  \n  \n The `char` members of the structure are small nonnegative numbers, not characters. Any of these that equals **CHAR_MAX** is not supported in the current locale.  \n  \n The elements of **grouping** and **mon_grouping** are interpreted according to the following rules.  \n  \n **CHAR_MAX**  \n Do not perform any further grouping.  \n  \n 0  \n Use previous element for each of remaining digits.  \n  \n *n*  \n Number of digits that make up current group. Next element is examined to determine size of next group of digits before current group.  \n  \n The values for **int_curr_symbol** are interpreted according to the following rules:  \n  \n-   The first three characters specify the alphabetic international currency symbol as defined in the *ISO 4217 Codes for the Representation of Currency and Funds* standard.  \n  \n-   The fourth character (immediately preceding the null character) separates the international currency symbol from the monetary quantity.  \n  \n The values for **p_cs_precedes** and **n_cs_precedes** are interpreted according to the following rules (the **n_cs_precedes** rule is in parentheses):  \n  \n 0  \n Currency symbol follows value for nonnegative (negative) formatted monetary value.  \n  \n 1  \n Currency symbol precedes value for nonnegative (negative) formatted monetary value.  \n  \n The values for **p_sep_by_space** and **n_sep_by_space** are interpreted according to the following rules (the **n_sep_by_space** rule is in parentheses):  \n  \n 0  \n Currency symbol is separated from value by space for nonnegative (negative) formatted monetary value.  \n  \n 1  \n There is no space separation between currency symbol and value for nonnegative (negative) formatted monetary value.  \n  \n The values for **p_sign_posn** and **n_sign_posn** are interpreted according to the following rules:  \n  \n 0  \n Parentheses surround quantity and currency symbol.  \n  \n 1  \n Sign string precedes quantity and currency symbol.  \n  \n 2  \n Sign string follows quantity and currency symbol.  \n  \n 3  \n Sign string immediately precedes currency symbol.  \n  \n 4  \n Sign string immediately follows currency symbol.  \n  \n## Requirements  \n  \n|Routine|Required header|  \n|-------------|---------------------|  \n|`localeconv`|\\<locale.h>|  \n  \n For additional compatibility information, see [Compatibility](../../c-runtime-library/compatibility.md) in the Introduction.  \n  \n## Libraries  \n All versions of the [C run-time libraries](../../c-runtime-library/crt-library-features.md).  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Locale](../../c-runtime-library/locale.md)   \n [setlocale](../../preprocessor/setlocale.md)   \n [strcoll Functions](../../c-runtime-library/strcoll-functions.md)   \n [strftime, wcsftime, _strftime_l, _wcsftime_l](../../c-runtime-library/reference/strftime-wcsftime-strftime-l-wcsftime-l.md)   \n [strxfrm, wcsxfrm, _strxfrm_l, _wcsxfrm_l](../../c-runtime-library/reference/strxfrm-wcsxfrm-strxfrm-l-wcsxfrm-l.md)"}
