Whereas in other Visual Studio languages, you can use the dot operator to access a member of a managed class, a pointer to the object in C++ means you have to use the -> operator to access the member:  \n  \n Wrong: `String * myString = checkedListBox1->CheckedItems->Item[0].ToString();`  \n  \n Right: `String * myString = checkedListBox1->CheckedItems->Item[0]->ToString();`"}
