during parallel algorithms. At the end of the parallel operation, the thread-private sub-computations can then be merged into a final result. This class can be used instead of a shared variable, and can result in a performance improvement if there would otherwise be a lot of contention on that shared variable.  \n  \n## Syntax  \n  \n```\ntemplate<typename T>\nclass combinable;\n```  \n  \n#### Parameters  \n `T`  \n The data type of the final merged result. The type must have a copy constructor and a default constructor.  \n  \n## Members  \n  \n### Public Constructors  \n  \n|Name|Description|  \n|----------|-----------------|  \n|[combinable::combinable Constructor](#ctor)|Overloaded.
