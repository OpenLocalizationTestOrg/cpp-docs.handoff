It defines its member function `operator()` as returning ( `_Pleft`->* `_Pm`)( ).  \n  \n## Example  \n The constructor of `mem_fun_t` is not usually used directly; the helper function `mem_fun` is used to adapt member functions. See [mem_fun](../standard-library/functional-functions.md#mem_fun_function) for an example of how to use member function adaptors.  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Header:** \\<functional>  \n  \n **Namespace:** std  \n  \n## See Also  \n [\\<functional>](../standard-library/functional.md)   \n [Thread Safety in the C++ Standard Library](../standard-library/thread-safety-in-the-cpp-standard-library.md)   \n [C++ Standard Library Reference](../standard-library/cpp-standard-library-reference.md)\n\n\n\n"}
