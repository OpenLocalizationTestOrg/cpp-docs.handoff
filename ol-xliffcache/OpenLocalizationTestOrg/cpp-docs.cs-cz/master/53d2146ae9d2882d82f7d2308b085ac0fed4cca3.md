# Compiler Error C3865
'calling_convention' : can only be used on native member functions  
  
 A calling convention was used on a function that was either a global function or on a managed member function. The calling convention can only be used on a native (not managed) member function.  
  
 For more information, see [Calling Conventions](../../cpp/calling-conventions.md).  
  
 The following sample generates C3865:  
  
```  
// C3865.cpp  
// compile with: /clr  
// processor: x86  
void __thiscall Func(){}   // C3865  
  
// OK  
struct MyType {  
   void __thiscall Func(){}  
};  
```
