Using SQL syntax, you can construct a statement that extracts records according to criteria you specify.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  This information applies to the MFC ODBC classes. If you are working with the MFC DAO classes, see the topic Comparison of Microsoft Jet Database Engine SQL and ANSI SQL in DAO Help.  \n  \n SQL statements begin with a keyword verb such as **CREATE** or **SELECT**. SQL is a very powerful language; a single statement can affect an entire table.  \n  \n Many versions of SQL exist, each developed with a particular DBMS in mind. The MFC database classes recognize a set of SQL statements that corresponds to the X/Open and SQL Access Group Common Applications Environment (CAE) SQL draft specification (1991).

This topic explains the relationship between the database classes and SQL.  \n  \n A recordset constructs a SQL statement by building up the pieces of a SQL statement into a `CString`. The string is constructed as a **SELECT** statement, which returns a set of records.  \n  \n When the recordset calls ODBC to send a SQL statement to the data source, the ODBC Driver Manager passes the statement to the ODBC driver and the driver sends it to the underlying DBMS. The DBMS returns a result set of records, and the ODBC driver returns the records to the application. The database classes let your program access the result set in a type-safe C++ class derived from `CRecordset`.  \n  \n The following topics provide more information about how the database classes use SQL:  \n  \n-   [SQL: Customizing Your Recordset's SQL Statement (ODBC)](../../data/odbc/sql-customizing-your-recordsets-sql-statement-odbc.md)  \n  \n-   [SQL: SQL and C++ Data Types (ODBC)](../../data/odbc/sql-sql-and-cpp-data-types-odbc.md)  \n  \n-   [SQL: Making Direct SQL Calls (ODBC)](../../data/odbc/sql-making-direct-sql-calls-odbc.md)  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Open Database Connectivity (ODBC)](../../data/odbc/open-database-connectivity-odbc.md)   \n [ODBC Basics](../../data/odbc/odbc-basics.md)"}
