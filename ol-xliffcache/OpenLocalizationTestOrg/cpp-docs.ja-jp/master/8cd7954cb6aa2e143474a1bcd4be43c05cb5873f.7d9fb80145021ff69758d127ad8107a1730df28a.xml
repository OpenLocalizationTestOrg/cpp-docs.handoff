You can later move it easily to Unicode or MBCS.  \n  \n-   Using Unicode makes your applications for Windows 2000 more efficient. Because Windows 2000 uses Unicode, non-Unicode strings passed to and from the operating system must be translated, which incurs overhead.  \n  \n-   Using MBCS enables you to support international markets on Win32 platforms other than Windows 2000, such as Windows 95 or Windows 98.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Unicode and MBCS](../text/unicode-and-mbcs.md)   \n [Support for Unicode](../text/support-for-unicode.md)"}
