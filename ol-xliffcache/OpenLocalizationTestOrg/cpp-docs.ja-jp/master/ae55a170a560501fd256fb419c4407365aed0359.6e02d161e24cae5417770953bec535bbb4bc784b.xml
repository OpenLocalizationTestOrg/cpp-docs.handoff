([CListCtrl](../mfc/reference/clistctrl-class.md)) is created depends on whether you're using the control directly or using class [CListView](../mfc/reference/clistview-class.md) instead. If you use `CListView`, the framework constructs the view as part of its document/view creation sequence. Creating the list view creates the list control as well (the two are the same thing). The control is created in the view's [OnCreate](../mfc/reference/cwnd-class.md#cwnd__oncreate) handler function. In this case, the control is ready for you to add items, via a call to [GetListCtrl](../mfc/reference/clistview-class.md#clistview__getlistctrl).  \n  \n### To use CListCtrl directly in a dialog box  \n  \n1.  In the dialog editor, add a List Control to your dialog template resource. Specify its control ID.  \n  \n2.  Use the [Add Member Variable Wizard](../ide/adding-a-member-variable-visual-cpp.md) to add a member variable of type `CListCtrl` with the Control property. You can use this member to call `CListCtrl` member functions.  \n  \n3.  Use the Properties window to map handler functions in the dialog class for any list control notification messages you need to handle (see [Mapping Messages to Functions](../mfc/reference/mapping-messages-to-functions.md)).  \n  \n4.  In [OnInitDialog](../mfc/reference/cdialog-class.md#cdialog__oninitdialog), set the styles for the `CListCtrl`. See [Changing List Control Styles](../mfc/changing-list-control-styles.md). This determines the kind of \"view\" you get in the control, although you can change the view later.  \n  \n### To use CListCtrl in a nondialog window  \n  \n1.  Define the control in the view or window class.  \n  \n2.  Call the control's [Create](../mfc/reference/clistctrl-class.md#clistctrl__create) member function, possibly in [OnInitialUpdate](../mfc/reference/cview-class.md#cview__oninitialupdate), possibly as early as the parent window's [OnCreate](../mfc/reference/cwnd-class.md#cwnd__oncreate) handler function (if you're subclassing the control). Set the styles for the control.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Using CListCtrl](../mfc/using-clistctrl.md)   \n [Controls](../mfc/controls-mfc.md)\n\n"}
