Memory will be written beyond the variable's memory location, and data loss is possible.  \n  \n To resolve this warning, only assign a value to a variable whose size can accommodate the value.  \n  \n The following sample generates C4739:  \n  \n```  \n// C4739.cpp  \n// compile with: /RTCs /Zi /W1 /c  \nchar *pc;  \nint main() {  \n   char c;  \n   *(int *)&c = 1;   // C4739  \n  \n   // OK  \n   *(char *)&c = 1;  \n}  \n```"}
