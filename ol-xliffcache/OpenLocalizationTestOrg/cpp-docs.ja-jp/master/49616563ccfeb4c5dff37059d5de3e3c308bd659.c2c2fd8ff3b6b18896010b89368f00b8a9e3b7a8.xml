The duration of the transition is determined by the difference between the initial value and the specified final value. Because all transitions are cleared automatically, it's recommended to allocated them using operator new. The encapsulated IUIAnimationTransition COM object is created by CAnimationController::AnimateGroup, until then it's NULL. Changing member variables after creation of this COM object has no effect.  \n  \n## Inheritance Hierarchy  \n [CObject](../../mfc/reference/cobject-class.md)  \n  \n [CBaseTransition](../../mfc/reference/cbasetransition-class.md)  \n  \n [CLinearTransitionFromSpeed](../../mfc/reference/clineartransitionfromspeed-class.md)  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Header:** afxanimationcontroller.h  \n  \n##  <a name=\"clineartransitionfromspeed__clineartransitionfromspeed\"></a>  CLinearTransitionFromSpeed::CLinearTransitionFromSpeed  \n Constructs a linear-speed transition object and initializes it with speed and final value.  \n  \n```  \nCLinearTransitionFromSpeed(\n    DOUBLE dblSpeed,  \n    DOUBLE dblFinalValue);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `dblSpeed`  \n The absolute value of the variable's velocity.  \n  \n `dblFinalValue`  \n The value of the animation variable at the end of the transition.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"clineartransitionfromspeed__create\"></a>  CLinearTransitionFromSpeed::Create  \n Calls the transition library to create encapsulated transition COM object.  \n  \n```  \nvirtual BOOL Create(\n    IUIAnimationTransitionLibrary* pLibrary,  \n    IUIAnimationTransitionFactory* */);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `pLibrary`  \n A pointer to transition library, which is responsible for creation of standard transitions.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n TRUE if transition is created successfully; otherwise FALSE.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"clineartransitionfromspeed__m_dblfinalvalue\"></a>  CLinearTransitionFromSpeed::m_dblFinalValue  \n The value of the animation variable at the end of the transition.  \n  \n```  \nDOUBLE m_dblFinalValue;  \n```  \n  \n##  <a name=\"clineartransitionfromspeed__m_dblspeed\"></a>  CLinearTransitionFromSpeed::m_dblSpeed  \n The absolute value of the variable's velocity.  \n  \n```  \nDOUBLE m_dblSpeed;  \n```  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Classes](../../mfc/reference/mfc-classes.md)\n"}
