stack environment and execution locale.  \n  \n## Syntax  \n  \n```  \n  \n      void longjmp(  \n   jmp_buf env,  \n   int value   \n);  \n```  \n  \n#### Parameters  \n `env`  \n Variable in which environment is stored.  \n  \n *value*  \n Value to be returned to `setjmp` call.  \n  \n## Remarks  \n The `longjmp` function restores a stack environment and execution locale previously saved in `env` by `setjmp`. `setjmp` and `longjmp` provide a way to execute a nonlocal `goto`; they are typically used to pass execution control to error-handling or recovery code in a previously called routine without using the normal call and return conventions.  \n  \n A call to `setjmp` causes the current stack environment to be saved in `env`. A subsequent call to `longjmp` restores the saved environment and returns control to the point immediately following the corresponding `setjmp` call. Execution resumes as if *value* had just been returned by the `setjmp` call. The values of all variables (except register variables) that are accessible to the routine receiving control contain the values they had when `longjmp` was called. The values of register variables are unpredictable. The value returned by `setjmp` must be nonzero. If *value* is passed as 0, the value 1 is substituted in the actual return.  \n  \n Call `longjmp` before the function that called `setjmp` returns; otherwise the results are unpredictable.  \n  \n Observe the following restrictions when using `longjmp`:  \n  \n-   Do not assume that the values of the register variables will remain the same. The values of register variables in the routine calling `setjmp` may not be restored to the proper values after `longjmp` is executed.  \n  \n-   Do not use `longjmp` to transfer control out of an interrupt-handling routine unless the interrupt is caused by a floating-point exception. In this case, a program may return from an interrupt handler via `longjmp` if it first reinitializes the floating-point math package by calling `_fpreset`.  \n  \n     **Note** Be careful when using `setjmp` and `longjmp` in C++ programs. Because these functions do not support C++ object semantics, it is safer to use the C++ exception-handling mechanism.  \n  \n For more information, see [Using setjmp and longjmp](../../cpp/using-setjmp-longjmp.md).  \n  \n## Requirements  \n  \n|Routine|Required header|  \n|-------------|---------------------|  \n|`longjmp`|\\<setjmp.h>|  \n  \n For additional compatibility information, see [Compatibility](../../c-runtime-library/compatibility.md) in the Introduction.  \n  \n## Libraries  \n All versions of the [C run-time libraries](../../c-runtime-library/crt-library-features.md).  \n  \n## Example  \n See the example for [_fpreset](../../c-runtime-library/reference/fpreset.md).  \n  \n## .NET Framework Equivalent  \n Not applicable.
