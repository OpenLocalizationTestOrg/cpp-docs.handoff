Comments are normally used to annotate code for future reference. The compiler treats them as white space. You can use comments in testing to make certain lines of code inactive; however, `#if`/`#endif` preprocessor directives work better for this because you can surround code that contains comments but you cannot nest comments.  \n  \n A C++ comment is written in one of the following ways:  \n  \n-   The `/*` (slash, asterisk) characters, followed by any sequence of characters (including new lines), followed by the `*/` characters. This syntax is the same as ANSI C.  \n  \n-   The `//` (two slashes) characters, followed by any sequence of characters. A new line not immediately preceded by a backslash terminates this form of comment. Therefore, it is commonly called a \"single-line comment.\"  \n  \n The comment characters (`/*`, `*/`, and `//`) have no special meaning within a character constant, string literal, or comment. Comments using the first syntax, therefore, cannot be nested.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Lexical Conventions](../cpp/lexical-conventions.md)"}
