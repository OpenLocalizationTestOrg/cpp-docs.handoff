The CRT exports these internal functions only to preserve binary compatibility.  \n  \n## Syntax  \n  \n```cpp  \nint ___setlc_active_func(void);  \nint * ___unguarded_readlc_active_add_func(void);  \n```  \n  \n## Return Value  \n The value returned is not significant.  \n  \n## Remarks  \n Although the internal CRT functions `___setlc_active_func` and `___unguarded_readlc_active_add_func` are obsolete and no longer used, they are exported by the CRT library to preserve binary compatibility. The original purpose of `___setlc_active_func` was to return the number of currently active calls to the `setlocale` function. The original purpose of `___unguarded_readlc_active_add_func` was to return the number of functions that referenced the locale without locking it.  \n  \n## Requirements  \n  \n|Routine|Required header|  \n|-------------|---------------------|  \n|`___setlc_active_func`, `___unguarded_readlc_active_add_func`|none|  \n  \n## See Also  \n [setlocale, _wsetlocale](../c-runtime-library/reference/setlocale-wsetlocale.md)"}
