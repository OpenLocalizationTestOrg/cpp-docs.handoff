Microsoft Foundation Class (MFC) Library provides an object-oriented wrapper over much of the Win32 and COM APIs. Although it can be used to create very simple desktop applications, it is most useful when you need to develop more complex user interfaces with multiple controls. You can use MFC to create applications with Office-style user interfaces.  \n  \n The MFC Reference covers the classes, global functions, global variables, and macros that make up the Microsoft Foundation Class Library.  \n  \n The individual hierarchy charts included with each class are useful for locating base classes. The MFC Reference usually does not describe inherited member functions or inherited operators. For information on these functions, refer to the base classes depicted in the hierarchy diagrams.  \n  \n The documentation for each class includes a class overview, a member summary by category, and topics for the member functions, overloaded operators, and data members.  \n  \n Public and protected class members are documented only when they are normally used in application programs or derived classes. See the class header files for a complete listing of class members.  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  The MFC classes and their members cannot be used in applications that execute in the Windows Runtime environment.  \n>   \n>  MFC libraries (DLLs) for multibyte character encoding (MBCS) are no longer included in Visual Studio, but are available as a Visual Studio add-on. For more information, see [MFC MBCS DLL Add-on](mfc-mbcs-dll-add-on.md).  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Concepts](mfc-concepts.md)  \n Conceptual articles on MFC topics.  \n  \n [Hierarchy Chart](hierarchy-chart.md)  \n Visually details the class relationships in the class library.  \n  \n [Class Overview](class-library-overview.md)  \n Lists the classes in the MFC Library according to category.  \n  \n [Walkthroughs](walkthroughs-mfc.md)  \n Contains articles that walk you through various tasks associated with MFC library features.  \n  \n [Technical Notes](mfc-technical-notes.md)  \n Provides links to specialized topics, written by the MFC development team, on the class library.  \n  \n [Customization for MFC](customization-for-mfc.md)  \n Provides some tips for customizing your MFC application.  \n  \n [Classes](reference/mfc-classes.md)  \n Provides links to and header file information for the MFC classes.  \n  \n [Internal Classes](reference/internal-classes.md)  \n Used internally in MFC.
