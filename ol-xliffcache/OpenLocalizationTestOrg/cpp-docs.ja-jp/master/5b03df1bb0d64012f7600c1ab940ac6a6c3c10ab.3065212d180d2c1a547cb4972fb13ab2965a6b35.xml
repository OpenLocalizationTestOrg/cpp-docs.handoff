Class\nA `multitype_join` messaging block is a multi-source, single-target messaging block that combines together messages of different types from each of its sources and offers a tuple of the combined messages to its targets.  \n  \n## Syntax  \n  \n```  \ntemplate<\n    typename T,  \n    join_type _Jtype = non_greedy  \n>  \nclass multitype_join: public ISource<typename _Unwrap<T>::type>;  \n```  \n  \n#### Parameters  \n `T`  \n The `tuple` payload type of the messages joined and propagated by the block.  \n  \n `_Jtype`  \n The kind of `join` block this is, either

The `Scheduler` object used is implied by the schedule group.  \n  \n `_Join`  \n A `multitype_join` messaging block to copy from. Note that the original object is orphaned, making this a move constructor.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The runtime uses the default scheduler if you do not specify the `_PScheduler` or `_PScheduleGroup` parameters.  \n  \n Move construction is not performed under a lock, which means that it is up to the user to make sure that there are no light-weight tasks in flight at the time of moving. Otherwise, numerous races can occur, leading to exceptions or inconsistent state.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"dtor\"></a>  multitype_join::~multitype_join Destructor  \n Destroys the `multitype_join` messaging block.  \n  \n```  \n~multitype_join();\n```  \n  \n##  <a name=\"release\"></a>  multitype_join::release Method  \n Releases a previous successful message reservation.  \n  \n```  \nvirtual void release(\n    runtime_object_identity _MsgId,  \n    _Inout_ ITarget<_Destination_type>* _PTarget);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `_MsgId`  \n The `runtime_object_identity` of the `message` object being released.  \n  \n `_PTarget`  \n A pointer to the target block that is calling the `release` method.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"release_ref\"></a>  multitype_join::release_ref Method  \n Releases a reference count on this `multiple_join` messaging block.  \n  \n```  \nvirtual void release_ref(_Inout_ ITarget<_Destination_type>* _PTarget);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `_PTarget`  \n A pointer to the target block that is calling this method.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n This method is called by an `ITarget` object that is being unlinked from this source. The source block is allowed to release any resources reserved for the target block.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"reserve\"></a>  multitype_join::reserve Method  \n Reserves a message previously offered by this `multitype_join` messaging block.  \n  \n```  \nvirtual bool reserve(\n    runtime_object_identity _MsgId,  \n    _Inout_ ITarget<_Destination_type>* _PTarget);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `_MsgId`  \n The `runtime_object_identity` of the `message` object being reserved.  \n  \n `_PTarget`  \n A pointer to the target block that is calling the `reserve` method.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n `true` if the message was successfully reserved, `false` otherwise. Reservations can fail for many reasons, including: the message was already reserved or accepted by another target, the source could deny reservations, and so forth.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n After you call `reserve`, if it succeeds, you must call either `consume` or `release` in order to take or give up possession of the message, respectively.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"unlink_target\"></a>  multitype_join::unlink_target Method  \n Unlinks a target block from this `multitype_join` messaging block.  \n  \n```  \nvirtual void unlink_target(_Inout_ ITarget<_Destination_type>* _PTarget);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `_PTarget`  \n A pointer to an `ITarget` block to unlink from this `multitype_join` messaging block.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"unlink_targets\"></a>  multitype_join::unlink_targets Method  \n Unlinks all targets from this `multitype_join` messaging block.  \n  \n```  \nvirtual void unlink_targets();\n```  \n  \n## See Also  \n [concurrency Namespace](concurrency-namespace.md)   \n [choice Class](choice-class.md)   \n [join Class](join-class.md)\n"}
