The window might be a main frame window, an MDI child window, a standard control, a dialog box, a view, or some other kind of child window.  \n  \n At run time, each Windows window is attached to a window object (derived directly or indirectly from `CWnd`) that has its own associated message map and handler functions. The framework uses the message map — as for a command — to map incoming messages to handlers.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [How the Framework Calls a Handler](../mfc/how-the-framework-calls-a-handler.md)\n\n"}
