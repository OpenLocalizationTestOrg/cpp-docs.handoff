The NONAME attribute causes only the ordinal value and not the function name to be stored in the DLL's export table, which reduces the file size.  \n  \n DLLs that are implicitly linked to an application are loaded when the application loads. To improve the performance when loading, try dividing the DLL into different DLLs. Put all the functions that the calling application needs immediately after loading into one DLL and have the calling application implicitly link to that DLL. Put the other functions that the calling application does not need right away into another DLL and have the application explicitly link to that DLL. For more information, see [Determining Which Linking Method to Use](../build/determining-which-linking-method-to-use.md).  \n  \n## See Also  \n [DLL Frequently Asked Questions](../build/dll-frequently-asked-questions.md)"}
