It is able to control conversions between a sequence of values used to encode characters within the program and a sequence of values used to encode characters outside the program.  \n  \n## Syntax  \n  \n```  \ntemplate <class CharType, class Byte, class StateType>  \nclass codecvt : public locale::facet, codecvt_base;  \n```  \n  \n#### Parameters  \n `CharType`  \n The type used within a program to encode characters.  \n  \n `Byte`  \n A type used to encode characters outside a program.  \n  \n `StateType`  \n A type that can be used to represent intermediate states of a conversion between internal and external types of character representations.  \n  \n## Remarks  \n The template class describes an object that can serve as a [locale facet](../standard-library/locale-class.md#facet_class), to control conversions between a sequence of values of type `CharType` and a sequence of values of type `Byte`. The class `StateType` characterizes the transformation -- and an object of class `StateType` stores any necessary state information during a conversion.  \n  \n The internal encoding uses a representation with a fixed number of bytes per character, usually either type `char` or type `wchar_t`.  \n  \n As with any locale facet, the static object `id` has an initial stored value of zero. The first attempt to access its stored value stores a unique positive value in `id`.  \n  \n The template versions of [do_in](#codecvt__do_in) and [do_out](#codecvt__do_out) always return `codecvt_base::noconv`.  \n  \n The Standard C++ Library defines several explicit specializations:  \n  \n `template<>`  \n  \n `codecvt<wchar_t, char, mbstate_t>`  \n  \n converts between `wchar_t` and `char` sequences.  \n  \n `template<>`  \n  \n `codecvt<char16_t, char, mbstate_t>`  \n  \n converts between `char16_t` sequences encoded as UTF-16 and `char` sequences encoded as UTF-8.  \n  \n `template<>`  \n  \n `codecvt<char32_t, char, mbstate_t>`  \n  \n converts between `char32_t` sequences encoded as UTF-32 (UCS-4) and `char` sequences encoded as UTF-8.  \n  \n### Constructors  \n  \n|||  \n|-|-|  \n|[codecvt](#codecvt__codecvt)|The constructor for objects of class `codecvt` that serves as a locale facet to handle conversions.|  \n  \n### Typedefs  \n  \n|||  \n|-|-|  \n|[extern_type](#codecvt__extern_type)|A character type that is used for external representations.|  \n|[intern_type](#codecvt__intern_type)|A character type that is used for internal representations.|  \n|[state_type](#codecvt__state_type)|A character type that is used to represent intermediate states during conversions between internal and external representations.|  \n  \n### Member Functions  \n  \n|||  \n|-|-|  \n|[always_noconv](#codecvt__always_noconv)|Tests whether no conversions need be done.|  \n|[do_always_noconv](#codecvt__do_always_noconv)|A virtual function called to test whether no conversions need be done.|  \n|[do_encoding](#codecvt__do_encoding)|A virtual function that tests if the encoding of the `Byte` stream is state dependent, whether the ratio between the `Byte`s used and the `CharType`s produced is constant, and, if so, determines the value of that ratio.|  \n|[do_in](#codecvt__do_in)|A virtual function called to convert a sequence of internal `Byte`s to a sequence of external `CharType`s.|  \n|[do_length](#codecvt__do_length)|A virtual function that determines how many `Byte`s from a given sequence of external `Byte`s produce not more than a given number of internal `CharType`s and returns that number of `Byte`s.|  \n|[do_max_length](#codecvt__do_max_length)|A virtual function that returns the maximum number of external Bytes necessary to produce one internal `CharType`.|  \n|[do_out](#codecvt__do_out)|A virtual function called to convert a sequence of internal `CharType`s to a sequence of external Bytes.|  \n|[do_unshift](#codecvt__do_unshift)|A virtual function called to provide the `Byte`s needed in a state-dependent conversion to complete the last character in a sequence of `Byte`s.|  \n|[encoding](#codecvt__encoding)|Tests if the encoding of the `Byte` stream is state dependent, whether the ratio between the `Byte`s used and the `CharType`s produced is constant, and, if so, determines the value of that ratio.|  \n|[in](#codecvt__in)|Converts an external representation of a sequence of `Byte`s to an internal representation of a sequence of `CharType`s.|  \n|[length](#codecvt__length)|Determines how many `Byte`s from a given sequence of external `Byte`s produce not more than a given number of internal `CharType`s and returns that number of `Byte`s.|  \n|[max_length](#codecvt__max_length)|Returns the maximum number of external `Byte`s necessary to produce one internal `CharType`.|  \n|[out](#codecvt__out)|Converts a sequence of internal `CharType`s to a sequence of external `Byte`s.|  \n|[unshift](#codecvt__unshift)|Provides the external `Byte`s needed in a state-dependent conversion to complete the last character in the sequence of `Byte`s.|  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Header:** \\<locale>  \n  \n **Namespace:** std  \n  \n##  <a name=\"codecvt__always_noconv\"></a>  codecvt::always_noconv  \n Tests whether no conversions need be done.  \n  \n```  \nbool always_noconv() const throw();\n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n A Boolean value that is **true** if no conversions need be done;

 \n  \nint main( )     \n{  \n   locale loc ( \"German_Germany\" );  \n   bool result1 = use_facet<codecvt<char, char, mbstate_t> >   \n      ( loc ).always_noconv( );  \n  \n   if ( result1 )  \n      cout << \"No conversion is needed.\" << endl;

 \n   else  \n      cout << \"At least one conversion is required.\" << endl;  \n}  \n```  \n  \n```Output  \nNo conversion is needed.  \nAt least one conversion is required.  \n```  \n  \n##  <a name=\"codecvt__codecvt\"></a>  codecvt::codecvt  \n The constructor for objects of class codecvt that serves as a locale facet to handle conversions.  \n  \n```  \nexplicit codecvt(size_t _Refs = 0);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `_Refs`  \n Integer value used to specify the type of memory management for the object.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The possible values for the `_Refs` parameter and their significance are:  \n  \n-   0: The lifetime of the object is managed by the locales that contain it.  \n  \n-   1: The lifetime of the object must be manually managed.  \n  \n-   \\> 0: These values are not defined.  \n  \n The constructor initializes its `locale::facet` base object with **locale::**[facet](../standard-library/locale-class.md#facet_class)( `_Refs`) *.*  \n  \n##  <a name=\"codecvt__do_always_noconv\"></a>  codecvt::do_always_noconv  \n A virtual function called to test whether no conversions need be done.  \n  \n```  \nvirtual bool do_always_noconv() const throw();\n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n The protected virtual member function returns **true** only if every call to [do_in](#codecvt__do_in) or [do_out](#codecvt__do_out) returns **noconv**.  \n  \n The template version always returns **true**.  \n  \n### Example  \n  See the example for [always_noconv](#codecvt__always_noconv), which calls `do_always_noconv`.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"codecvt__do_encoding\"></a>  codecvt::do_encoding  \n A virtual function that tests if the encoding of the **Byte** stream is state dependent, whether the ratio between the **Byte**s used and the **CharType**s produced is constant and, if so, determines the value of that ratio.  \n  \n```  \nvirtual int do_encoding() const throw();\n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n The protected virtual member function returns:  \n  \n-   –1, if the encoding of sequences of type `extern_type` is state dependent.  \n  \n-   0, if the encoding involves sequences of varying lengths.  \n  \n- *N*, if the encoding involves only sequences of length *N*  \n  \n### Example  \n  See the example for [encoding](#codecvt__encoding), which calls `do_encoding`.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"codecvt__do_in\"></a>  codecvt::do_in  \n A virtual function called to convert a sequence of external **Byte**s to a sequence of internal **CharType**s.  \n  \n```  \nvirtual result do_in(\n    StateType& _State,  \n    const Byte* first1,   \n    const Byte* last1,   \n    const Byte*& next1,  \n    CharType* first2,  \n    CharType* last2,  \n    CharType*& next2,) const;\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `_State`  \n The conversion state that is maintained between calls to the member function.  \n  \n ` first1`  \n Pointer to the beginning of the sequence to be converted.  \n  \n ` last1`  \n Pointer to the end of the sequence to be converted.  \n  \n ` next1`  \n Pointer beyond the end of the converted sequence, to the first unconverted character.  \n  \n ` first2`  \n Pointer to the beginning of the converted sequence.  \n  \n ` last2`  \n Pointer to the end of the converted sequence.  \n  \n ` next2`  \n Pointer to the **CharType** that comes after the last converted **CharType**, to the first unaltered character in the destination sequence.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n A return that indicates the success, partial success, or failure of the operation. The function returns:  \n  \n- **codecvt_base::error** if the source sequence is ill formed.  \n  \n- `codecvt_base::noconv` if the function performs no conversion.  \n  \n- **codecvt_base::ok** if the conversion succeeds.  \n  \n- **codecvt_base::partial** if the source is insufficient or if the destination is not large enough, for the conversion to succeed.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n `_State` must represent the initial conversion state at the beginning of a new source sequence. The function alters its stored value as needed to reflect the current state of a successful conversion. Its stored value is otherwise unspecified.  \n  \n### Example  \n  See the example for [in](#codecvt__in), which calls `do_in`.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"codecvt__do_length\"></a>  codecvt::do_length  \n A virtual function that determines how many **Byte**s from a given sequence of external **Byte**s produce not more than a given number of internal **CharType**s and returns that number of **Byte**s.  \n  \n```  \nvirtual int do_length(\n    const StateType& _State,  \n    const Byte* first1,   \n    const Byte* last1,  \n    size_t _Len2) const;\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `_State`  \n The conversion state that is maintained between calls to the member function.  \n  \n ` first1`  \n Pointer to the beginning of the external sequence.  \n  \n ` last1`  \n Pointer to the end of the external sequence.  \n  \n `_Len2`  \n The maximum number of **Byte**s that can be returned by the member function.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n An integer that represents a count of the maximum number of conversions, not greater than `_Len2`, defined by the external source sequence at [ ` first1`, ` last1`).  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The protected virtual member function effectively calls `do_in`( `_State`, ` first1`, ` last1`, ` next1`, `_Buf`, `_Buf` + `_Len2`, ` next2`) for `_State` (a copy of state), some buffer `_Buf`, and pointers ` next1`and ` next2`.  \n  \n It then returns ` next2` – **buf**. Thus, it counts the maximum number of conversions, not greater than `_Len2`, defined by the source sequence at [ ` first1`, ` last1`).  \n  \n The template version always returns the lesser of ` last1` – ` first1` and `_Len2`.  \n  \n### Example  \n  See the example for [length](#codecvt__length), which calls **do_length**.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"codecvt__do_max_length\"></a>  codecvt::do_max_length  \n A virtual function that returns the maximum number of external **Byte**s necessary to produce one internal **CharType**.  \n  \n```  \nvirtual int do_max_length() const throw();\n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n The maximum number of **Byte**s necessary to produce one **CharType**.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The protected virtual member function returns the largest permissible value that can be returned by [do_length](#codecvt__do_length)( ` first1`, ` last1`, 1) for arbitrary valid values of ` first1` and ` last1`.  \n  \n### Example  \n  See the example for [max_length](#codecvt__max_length), which calls `do_max_length`.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"codecvt__do_out\"></a>  codecvt::do_out  \n A virtual function called to convert a sequence of internal **CharType**s to a sequence of external **Byte**s.  \n  \n```  \nvirtual result do_out(\n    StateType& _State,  \n    const CharType* first1,   \n    const CharType* last1,  \n    const CharType*& next1,  \n    Byte* first2,   \n    Byte* last2,   \n    Byte*& next2) const;\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `_State`  \n The conversion state that is maintained between calls to the member function.  \n  \n ` first1`  \n Pointer to the beginning of the sequence to be converted.  \n  \n ` last1`  \n Pointer to the end of the sequence to be converted.  \n  \n ` next1`  \n Reference to a pointer to the first unconverted **CharType**, after the last **CharType** converted.  \n  \n ` first2`  \n Pointer to the beginning of the converted sequence.  \n  \n ` last2`  \n Pointer to the end of the converted sequence.  \n  \n ` next2`  \n Reference to a pointer to the first unconverted **Byte**, after the last **Byte** converted.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n The function returns:  \n  \n- **codecvt_base::error** if the source sequence is ill formed.  \n  \n- `codecvt_base::noconv` if the function performs no conversion.  \n  \n- **codecvt_base::ok** if the conversion succeeds.  \n  \n- **codecvt_base::partial** if the source is insufficient or if the destination is not large enough for the conversion to succeed.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n `_State` must represent the initial conversion state at the beginning of a new source sequence. The function alters its stored value as needed to reflect the current state of a successful conversion. Its stored value is otherwise unspecified.  \n  \n### Example  \n  See the example for [out](#codecvt__out), which calls `do_out`.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"codecvt__do_unshift\"></a>  codecvt::do_unshift  \n A virtual function called to provide the **Byte**s needed in a state-dependent conversion to complete the last character in a sequence of **Byte**s.  \n  \n```  \nvirtual result do_unshift(\n    StateType& _State,  \n    Byte* first2,   \n    Byte* last2,   \n    Byte*& next2) const;\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `_State`  \n The conversion state that is maintained between calls to the member function.  \n  \n ` first2`  \n Pointer to the first position in the destination range.  \n  \n ` last2`  \n Pointer to the last position in the destination range.  \n  \n ` next2`  \n Pointer to the first unaltered element in the destination sequence.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n The function returns:  \n  \n- **codecvt_base::error** if _ *State* represents an invalid state  \n  \n- `codecvt_base::noconv` if the function performs no conversion  \n  \n- **codecvt_base::ok** if the conversion succeeds  \n  \n- **codecvt_base::partial** if the destination is not large enough for the conversion to succeed  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The protected virtual member function tries to convert the source element **CharType**(0) to a destination sequence that it stores within [ ` first2`, ` last2`), except for the terminating element **Byte**(0). It always stores in ` next2` a pointer to the first unaltered element in the destination sequence.  \n  \n _ *State* must represent the initial conversion state at the beginning of a new source sequence. The function alters its stored value as needed to reflect the current state of a successful conversion. Typically, converting the source element **CharType**(0) leaves the current state in the initial conversion state.  \n  \n### Example  \n  See the example for [unshift](#codecvt__unshift), which calls `do_unshift`.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"codecvt__encoding\"></a>  codecvt::encoding  \n Tests if the encoding of the **Byte** stream is state dependent, whether the ratio between the **Byte**s used and the **CharType**s produced is constant, and, if so, determines the value of that ratio.  \n  \n```  \nint encoding() const throw();\n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n If the return value is positive then that value is the constant number of **Byte** characters required to produce the **CharType** character.  \n  \n The protected virtual member function returns:  \n  \n-   –1, if the encoding of sequences of type `extern_type` is state dependent.  \n  \n-   0, if the encoding involves sequences of varying lengths.  \n  \n- *N*, if the encoding involves only sequences of length *N.*  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The member function returns [do_encoding](#codecvt__do_encoding).  \n  \n### Example  \n  \n```cpp  \n// codecvt_encoding.cpp  \n// compile with: /EHsc  \n#include <locale>  \n#include <iostream>  \nusing namespace std;  \n  \nint main( )     \n{  \n   locale loc ( \"German_Germany\" );  \n   int result1 = use_facet<codecvt<char, char, mbstate_t> > ( loc ).encoding ( );  \n   cout << result1 << endl;  \n   result1 = use_facet<codecvt<wchar_t, char, mbstate_t> > ( loc ).encoding( );  \n   cout << result1 << endl;  \n   result1 = use_facet<codecvt<char, wchar_t, mbstate_t> > ( loc ).encoding( );  \n   cout << result1 << endl;  \n}  \n```  \n  \n```Output  \n1  \n1  \n1  \n```  \n  \n##  <a name=\"codecvt__extern_type\"></a>  codecvt::extern_type  \n A character type that is used for external representations.  \n  \n```  \ntypedef Byte extern_type;  \n```  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The type is a synonym for the template parameter **Byte**.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"codecvt__in\"></a>  codecvt::in  \n Converts an external representation of a sequence of **Byte**s to an internal representation of a sequence of **CharType**s.  \n  \n```  \nresult in(\n    StateType& _State,  \n    const Byte* first1,   \n    const Byte* last1,   \n    const Byte*& next1,  \n    CharType* first2,  \n    CharType* last2,  \n    CharType*& next2,) const;\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `_State`  \n The conversion state that is maintained between calls to the member function.  \n  \n ` first1`  \n Pointer to the beginning of the sequence to be converted.  \n  \n ` last1`  \n Pointer to the end of the sequence to be converted.  \n  \n ` next1`  \n Pointer beyond the end of the converted sequence to the first unconverted character.  \n  \n ` first2`  \n Pointer to the beginning of the converted sequence.  \n  \n ` last2`  \n Pointer to the end of the converted sequence.  \n  \n ` next2`  \n Pointer to the **CharType** that comes after the last converted **Chartype** to the first unaltered character in the destination sequence.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n A return that indicates the success, partial success or failure of the operation. The function returns:  \n  \n- **codecvt_base::error** if the source sequence is ill formed.  \n  \n- `codecvt_base::noconv` if the function performs no conversion.  \n  \n- **codecvt_base::ok** if the conversion succeeds.  \n  \n- **codecvt_base::partial** if the source is insufficient or if the destination is not large enough for the conversion to succeed.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n `_State` must represent the initial conversion state at the beginning of a new source sequence. The function alters its stored value, as needed, to reflect the current state of a successful conversion. After a partial conversion, `_State` must be set so as to allow the conversion to resume when new characters arrive.  \n  \n The member function returns [do_in](#codecvt__do_in)( `_State`, _ *First1,  last1,  next1, First2, _Llast2,  next2*).  \n  \n### Example  \n  \n```cpp  \n// codecvt_in.cpp  \n// compile with: /EHsc  \n#define _INTL  \n#include <locale>  \n#include <iostream>  \nusing namespace std;  \n#define LEN 90  \nint main( )     \n{  \n   char* pszExt = \"This is the string to be converted!\";  \n   wchar_t pwszInt [LEN+1];  \n   memset(&pwszInt[0], 0, (sizeof(wchar_t))*(LEN+1));  \n   const char* pszNext;  \n   wchar_t* pwszNext;  \n   mbstate_t state = {0};  \n   locale loc(\"C\");//English_Britain\");//German_Germany  \n   int res = use_facet<codecvt<wchar_t, char, mbstate_t> >  \n     ( loc ).in( state,  \n          pszExt, &pszExt[strlen(pszExt)], pszNext,  \n          pwszInt, &pwszInt[strlen(pszExt)], pwszNext );  \n   pwszInt[strlen(pszExt)] = 0;  \n   wcout << ( (res!=codecvt_base::error)  L\"It worked! \" : L\"It didn't work! \" )  \n   << L\"The converted string is:\\n [\"  \n   << &pwszInt[0]  \n   << L\"]\" << endl;  \n   exit(-1);  \n}  \n```  \n  \n```Output  \nIt worked!

It always stores in ` next2` a pointer to the first unaltered element in the destination sequence.  \n  \n `_State` must represent the initial conversion state at the beginning of a new source sequence. The function alters its stored value, as needed, to reflect the current state of a successful conversion. Typically, converting the source element **CharType**(0) leaves the current state in the initial conversion state.  \n  \n The member function returns [do_unshift](#codecvt__do_unshift)( `_State`, ` first2`, ` last2`, ` next2` ).  \n  \n## See Also  \n [\\<locale>](../standard-library/locale.md)   \n [Code Pages](../c-runtime-library/code-pages.md)   \n [Locale Names, Languages, and Country/Region Strings](../c-runtime-library/locale-names-languages-and-country-region-strings.md)   \n [Thread Safety in the C++ Standard Library](../standard-library/thread-safety-in-the-cpp-standard-library.md)\n\n"}
