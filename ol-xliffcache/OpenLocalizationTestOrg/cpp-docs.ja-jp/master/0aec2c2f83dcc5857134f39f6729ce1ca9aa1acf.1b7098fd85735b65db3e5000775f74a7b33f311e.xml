interface in an available type library. You can add an MFC class to an [MFC application](../../mfc/reference/creating-an-mfc-application.md), an [MFC DLL](../../mfc/reference/creating-an-mfc-dll-project.md), or an [MFC ActiveX control](../../mfc/reference/creating-an-mfc-activex-control.md).  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  You do not need to create your MFC project with Automation enabled to add a class from a type library.  \n  \n A type library contains a binary description of the interfaces exposed by a component, defining the methods along with their parameters and return types. Your type library must be registered for it to appear in the **Available type libraries** list in the Add Class from Typelib Wizard. See \"Inside Distributed COM: Type Libraries and Language Integration\" in the MSDN library for more information.  \n  \n### To add an MFC class from a type library  \n  \n1.  In either **Solution Explorer** or [Class View](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/8d7430a9-3e33-454c-a9e1-a85e3d2db925), right-click the name of the project to which you want to add the class.  \n  \n2.  From the shortcut menu, click **Add**, and then click **Add Class**.  \n  \n3.  In the [Add Class](../../ide/add-class-dialog-box.md) dialog box, in the Templates pane, click **MFC Class from Typelib**, and then click **Open** to display the [Add Class from Typelib Wizard](../../mfc/reference/add-class-from-typelib-wizard.md).  \n  \n In the wizard, you can add more than one class in a type library. Likewise, you can add classes from more than one type library in a single wizard session.  \n  \n The wizard creates an MFC class, derived from [COleDispatchDriver](../../mfc/reference/coledispatchdriver-class.md), for each interface you add from the selected type library. `COleDispatchDriver` implements the client side of OLE automation.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Automation Clients](../../mfc/automation-clients.md)   \n [Automation Clients: Using Type Libraries](../../mfc/automation-clients-using-type-libraries.md)\n\n"}
