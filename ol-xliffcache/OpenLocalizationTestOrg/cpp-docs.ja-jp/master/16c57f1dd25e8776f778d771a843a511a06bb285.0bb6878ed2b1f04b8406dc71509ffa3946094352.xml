If you want to use the native type in the signature of a public function in a type with public assembly visibility, the native type must also have public assembly accessibility or the compiler will issue a warning.  \n  \n`make_public` must be specified at global scope and is only in effect from the point at which it is declared through to the end of the source code file.  \n  \nThe native type may be implicitly or explicitly private; see [Type Visibility](../dotnet/how-to-define-and-consume-classes-and-structs-cpp-cli.md#BKMK_Type_visibility) for more information.  \n  \n## Example  \nThe following sample is the contents of a .h file that contains the definitions for two native structs.  \n  \n```cpp  \n// make_public_pragma.h  \nstruct Native_Struct_1 { int i; };  \nstruct Native_Struct_2 { int i; };  \n```  \n  \n## Example  \nThe following code sample consumes the header file and shows that unless you explicitly mark the native structs as public, using `make_public`, the compiler will generate a warning when you attempt to use the native structs in the signature of public function in a public managed type.  \n  \n```cpp  \n// make_public_pragma.cpp  \n// compile with: /c /clr /W1  \n#pragma warning (default : 4692)  \n#include \"make_public_pragma.h\"  \n#pragma make_public(Native_Struct_1)  \n  \npublic ref struct A {  \n   void Test(Native_Struct_1 u) {u.i = 0;}   // OK  \n   void Test(Native_Struct_2 u) {u.i = 0;}   // C4692  \n};  \n```  \n  \n## See Also  \n[Pragma Directives and the __Pragma Keyword](../preprocessor/pragma-directives-and-the-pragma-keyword.md)"}
