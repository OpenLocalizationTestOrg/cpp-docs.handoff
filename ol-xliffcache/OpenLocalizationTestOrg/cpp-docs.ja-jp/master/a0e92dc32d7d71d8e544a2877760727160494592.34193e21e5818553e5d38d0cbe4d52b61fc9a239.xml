Because they are slower than whole-object pointers and require special handling by the garbage collector, you cannot declare interior managed pointers as members of a class.  \n  \n The following sample generates C3160:  \n  \n```  \n// C3160.cpp  \n// compile with: /clr  \nref struct A {  \n   // cannot create interior pointers inside a class  \n   interior_ptr<int> pg;   // C3160  \n   int g;   // OK  \n   int* pg2;   // OK  \n};  \n  \nint main() {  \n   interior_ptr<int> pg2;   // OK  \n}  \n```  \n"}
