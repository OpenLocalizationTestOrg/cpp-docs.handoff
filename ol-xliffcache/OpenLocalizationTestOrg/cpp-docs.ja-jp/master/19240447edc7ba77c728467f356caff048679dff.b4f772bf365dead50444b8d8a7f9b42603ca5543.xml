The work-sharing directives do not launch new threads, and there is no implied barrier on entry to a work-sharing construct.  \n  \n The sequence of work-sharing constructs and **barrier** directives encountered must be the same for every thread in a team.  \n  \n OpenMP defines the following work-sharing constructs, and these are described in the sections that follow:  \n  \n-   **for** directive  \n  \n-   **sections** directive  \n  \n-   **single** directive"}
