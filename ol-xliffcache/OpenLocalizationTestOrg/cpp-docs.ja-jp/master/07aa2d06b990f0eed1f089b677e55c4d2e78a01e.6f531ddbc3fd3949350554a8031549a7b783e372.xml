There are several possible reasons for this error, but often it's caused by a defect in the app's code.  \n>   \n>  You can try these steps to fix this error:  \n>   \n>  -   Use the **Apps and Features** or **Programs and Features** page in the **Control Panel** to repair or reinstall the program.  \n> -   Check **Windows Update** in the **Control Panel** for software updates.  \n> -   Check for an updated version of the app. Contact the app vendor if the problem persists.  \n  \n **Information for Programmers**  \n  \n The program encountered an unexpected error while performing a memory-management operation.  \n  \n This error usually occurs if the program inadvertently alters the run-time heap data. However, it can also be caused by an internal error in the runtime or operating-system code.  \n  \n To fix this issue, check for heap corruption bugs in your code. For more information and examples, see [CRT Debug Heap Details](/visualstudio/debugger/crt-debug-heap-details). Next, check that you are using the latest redistributables for your app deployment. For information, see [Deployment in Visual C++](../../ide/deployment-in-visual-cpp.md)."}
