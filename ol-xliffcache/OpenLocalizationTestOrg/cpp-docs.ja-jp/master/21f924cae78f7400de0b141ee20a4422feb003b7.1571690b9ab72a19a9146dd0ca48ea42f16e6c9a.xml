If the definition of the constructor S2::S2( int i, ... ) was compiled by using a version of the Visual C++ compiler before version 7, but the following example is compiled by using the current version, the call to the constructor for S3 would not work correctly because of a special-case calling-convention change. If both were compiled by using Visual C++ 6.0, the call would not work quite right either, unless no parameters were passed for the ellipsis.  \n  \n To fix this warning,  \n  \n1.  Don't use ellipsis in a constructor.  \n  \n2.  Make sure that all components in their project are built with the current version (including any libraries that may define or reference this class), then disable the warning using the [warning](../../preprocessor/warning.md) pragma.  \n  \n The following sample generates C4256:  \n  \n```  \n// C4256.cpp  \n// compile with: /W4  \n// #pragma warning(disable : 4256)  \nstruct S1  \n{  \n};  \n  \nstruct S2: virtual public S1  \n{  \n   S2( int i, ... )    // C4256  \n   {  \n      i = 0;  \n   }  \n   /*  \n   // try the following line instead  \n   S2( int i)  \n   {  \n      i = 0;  \n   }  \n   */  \n};  \n  \nvoid func1()  \n{  \n   S2 S3( 2, 1, 2 );   // C4256  \n   // try the following line instead  \n   // S2 S3( 2 );  \n}  \n  \nint main()  \n{  \n}  \n```"}
