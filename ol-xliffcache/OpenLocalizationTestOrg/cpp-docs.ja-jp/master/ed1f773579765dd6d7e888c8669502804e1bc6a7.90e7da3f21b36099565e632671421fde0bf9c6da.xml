An \"expression\" is a sequence of operators and operands that performs any combination of these actions:  \n  \n-   Computes a value  \n  \n-   Designates an object or function  \n  \n-   Generates side effects  \n  \n Operands in C include constants, identifiers, strings, function calls, subscript expressions, member-selection expressions, and complex expressions formed by combining operands with operators or by enclosing operands in parentheses. The syntax for these operands is given in [Primary Expressions](../c-language/c-primary-expressions.md).  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Expressions and Assignments](../c-language/expressions-and-assignments.md)"}
