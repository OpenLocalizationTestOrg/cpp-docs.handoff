The symbol will evaluate to false. To define a symbol, you can use either the [#define directive](../../preprocessor/hash-define-directive-c-cpp.md) or [/D](../../build/reference/d-preprocessor-definitions.md) compiler option.  \n  \n This warning is off by default. See [Compiler Warnings That Are Off by Default](../../preprocessor/compiler-warnings-that-are-off-by-default.md) for more information.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following sample generates C4668:  \n  \n```  \n// C4668.cpp  \n// compile with: /W4  \n#include <stdio.h>  \n  \n#pragma warning (default : 4668)   // turn warning on  \n  \nint main()   \n{  \n    #if q   // C4668, q is not defined  \n        printf_s(\"defined\");  \n    #else  \n        printf_s(\"undefined\");  \n    #endif  \n}  \n```"}
