# Container Class::swap
> [!NOTE]
>  This topic is in the Visual C++ documentation as a nonfunctional example of containers used in the Standard C++ Library. For more information, see [STL Containers](../standard-library/stl-containers.md).  
  
 Swaps the controlled sequences between **\*this** and ` right`.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
 
    void swap(Container& right);
```  
  
## Remarks  
 If **get_allocator ==** ` right`**.get_allocator**, it does so in constant time. Otherwise, it performs a number of element assignments and constructor calls proportional to the number of elements in the two controlled sequences.
