 \nwchar_t *_wfullpath(   \n   wchar_t *absPath,  \n   const wchar_t *relPath,  \n   size_t maxLength   \n);  \n```  \n  \n#### Parameters  \n `absPath`  \n Pointer to a buffer containing the absolute or full path name, or NULL.  \n  \n `relPath`  \n Relative path name.  \n  \n `maxLength`  \n Maximum length of the absolute path name buffer (`absPath`). This length is in bytes for `_fullpath` but in wide characters (`wchar_t`) for `_wfullpath`.  \n  \n## Return Value  \n Each of these functions returns a pointer to a buffer containing the absolute path name (`absPath`). If there is an error (for example, if the value passed in `relPath` includes a drive letter that is not valid or cannot be found, or if the length of the created absolute path name (`absPath`) is greater than `maxLength`), the function returns `NULL`.  \n  \n## Remarks  \n The `_fullpath` function expands the relative path name in `relPath` to its fully qualified or absolute path and stores this name in `absPath`*.* If `absPath` is NULL, `malloc` is used to allocate a buffer of sufficient length to hold the path name. It is the responsibility of the caller to free this buffer. A relative path name specifies a path to another location from the current location (such as the current working directory: \".\"). An absolute path name is the expansion of a relative path name that states the entire path required to reach the desired location from the root of the file system. Unlike `_makepath`, `_fullpath` can be used to obtain the absolute path name for relative paths (`relPath`) that include \"./\" or \"../\" in their names.  \n  \n For example, to use C run-time routines, the application must include the header files that contain the declarations for the routines. Each header file include statement references the location of the file in a relative manner (from the application's working directory):  \n  \n```  \n#include <stdlib.h>  \n```  \n  \n when the absolute path (actual file system location) of the file might be:  \n  \n```  \n\\\\machine\\shareName\\msvcSrc\\crt\\headerFiles\\stdlib.h  \n```  \n  \n `_fullpath` automatically handles multibyte-character string arguments as appropriate, recognizing multibyte-character sequences according to the multibyte code page currently in use. `_wfullpath` is a wide-character version of `_fullpath`; the string arguments to `_wfullpath` are wide-character strings. `_wfullpath` and `_fullpath` behave identically except that `_wfullpath` does not handle multibyte-character strings.  \n  \n If `_DEBUG` and `_CRTDBG_MAP_ALLOC` are both defined, calls to `_fullpath` and `_wfullpath` are replaced by calls to `_fullpath_dbg` and `_wfullpath_dbg` to allow for debugging memory allocations. For more information, see [_fullpath_dbg, _wfullpath_dbg](../../c-runtime-library/reference/fullpath-dbg-wfullpath-dbg.md).  \n  \n This function invokes the invalid parameter handler, as described in [Parameter Validation](../../c-runtime-library/parameter-validation.md), if `maxlen` is less than or equal to 0. If execution is allowed to continue, this function sets `errno` to `EINVAL` and returns `NULL`.  \n  \n### Generic-Text Routine Mappings  \n  \n|Tchar.h routine|_UNICODE and _MBCS not defined|_MBCS defined|_UNICODE defined|  \n|---------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|  \n|`_tfullpath`|`_fullpath`|`_fullpath`|`_wfullpath`|  \n  \n If the `absPath` buffer is `NULL`, `_fullpath` calls [malloc](../../c-runtime-library/reference/malloc.md) to allocate a buffer and ignores the `maxLength` argument. It is the caller's responsibility to deallocate this buffer (using [free](../../c-runtime-library/reference/free.md)) as appropriate. If the `relPath` argument specifies a disk drive, the current directory of this drive is combined with the path.  \n  \n## Requirements  \n  \n|Function|Required header|  \n|--------------|---------------------|  \n|`_fullpath`|\\<stdlib.h>|  \n|`_wfullpath`|\\<stdlib.h> or \\<wchar.h>|  \n  \n For more compatibility information, see [Compatibility](../../c-runtime-library/compatibility.md) in the Introduction.  \n  \n## Example  \n  \n```  \n// crt_fullpath.c  \n// This program demonstrates how _fullpath  \n// creates a full path from a partial path.  \n  \n#include <stdio.h>  \n#include <conio.h>  \n#include <stdlib.h>  \n#include <direct.h>  \n  \nvoid PrintFullPath( char * partialPath )  \n{  \n   char full[_MAX_PATH];  \n   if( _fullpath( full, partialPath, _MAX_PATH ) != NULL )  \n      printf( \"Full path is: %s\\n\", full );  \n   else  \n      printf( \"Invalid path\\n\" );  \n}  \n  \nint main( void )  \n{  \n   PrintFullPath( \"test\" );  \n   PrintFullPath( \"\\\\test\" );  \n   PrintFullPath( \"..\\\\test\" );  \n}  \n```  \n  \n```Output  \nFull path is: C:\\Documents and Settings\\user\\My Documents\\test  \nFull path is: C:\\test  \nFull path is: C:\\Documents and Settings\\user\\test  \n```  \n  \n## .NET Framework Equivalent  \n [System::IO::File::Create](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.io.file.create.aspx)  \n  \n## See Also  \n [File Handling](../../c-runtime-library/file-handling.md)   \n [_getcwd, _wgetcwd](../../c-runtime-library/reference/getcwd-wgetcwd.md)   \n [_getdcwd, _wgetdcwd](../../c-runtime-library/reference/getdcwd-wgetdcwd.md)   \n [_makepath, _wmakepath](../../c-runtime-library/reference/makepath-wmakepath.md)   \n [_splitpath, _wsplitpath](../../c-runtime-library/reference/splitpath-wsplitpath.md)"}
