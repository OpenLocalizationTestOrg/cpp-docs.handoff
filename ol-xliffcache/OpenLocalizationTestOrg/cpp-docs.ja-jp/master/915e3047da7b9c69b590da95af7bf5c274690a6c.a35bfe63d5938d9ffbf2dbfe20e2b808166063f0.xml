You should consider using more than one thread if your application needs to manage multiple activities, such as simultaneous keyboard and mouse input. One thread can process keyboard input while a second thread filters mouse activities. A third thread can update the display screen based on data from the mouse and keyboard threads. At the same time, other threads can access disk files or get data from a communications port.  \n  \n With Visual C++, there are two ways to program with multiple threads: use the Microsoft Foundation Class (MFC) library or the C run-time library and the Win32 API. For information about creating multithread applications with MFC, see [Multithreading with C++ and MFC](../parallel/multithreading-with-cpp-and-mfc.md) after reading the following topics about multithreading in C.  \n  \n These topics explain the features in Visual C++ that support the creation of multithread programs.  \n  \n## What do you want to know more about?  \n  \n-   [What multithreading is about](../parallel/multithread-programs.md)  \n  \n-   [Library support for multithreading](../parallel/library-support-for-multithreading.md)  \n  \n-   [Include files for multithreading](../parallel/include-files-for-multithreading.md)  \n  \n-   [C Run-Time library functions for thread control](../parallel/c-run-time-library-functions-for-thread-control.md)  \n  \n-   [Sample multithread program in C](../parallel/sample-multithread-c-program.md)  \n  \n-   [Writing a Multithread Win32 Program](../parallel/writing-a-multithreaded-win32-program.md)  \n  \n-   [Compiling and linking multithread programs](../parallel/compiling-and-linking-multithread-programs.md)  \n  \n-   [Avoiding problem areas with multithread programs](../parallel/avoiding-problem-areas-with-multithread-programs.md)  \n  \n-   [Thread local storage (TLS)](../parallel/thread-local-storage-tls.md)  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Multithreading Support for Older Code (Visual C++)](../parallel/multithreading-support-for-older-code-visual-cpp.md)"}
