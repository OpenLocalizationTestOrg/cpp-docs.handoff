When the pointer is positioned on a sizing handle, it changes shape to indicate the directions in which the control can be resized. Active sizing handles are solid; if a sizing handle is hollow, the control cannot be resized along that axis.  \n  \n You can also change the size of a control by snapping the control to guides or margins, or by moving one snapped control and guide away from another.  \n  \n### To size a control  \n  \n1.  Select the control.  \n  \n2.  Drag the sizing handles to change the size of the control:  \n  \n    -   Sizing handles at the top and sides change the horizontal or vertical size.  \n  \n    -   Sizing handles at the corners change both horizontal and vertical size.  \n  \n    > [!TIP]\n    >  You can resize the control one dialog unit (DLU) at a time by holding down the SHIFT key and using the Right and Down ARROW keys.  \n  \n### To automatically size a control to fit the text within it  \n  \n1.  Choose **Size to Content** from the **Format** menu.  \n  \n \\- or -  \n  \n-   Right-click the control and choose **Size to Content** from the shortcut menu.  \n  \n For information on adding resources to managed projects, please see [Resources in Applications](http://msdn.microsoft.com/Library/8ad495d4-2941-40cf-bf64-e82e85825890) in the *.NET Framework Developer's Guide.* For information on manually adding resource files to managed projects, accessing resources, displaying static resources, and assigning resources strings to properties, see [Walkthrough: Localizing Windows Forms](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/9a96220d-a19b-4de0-9f48-01e5d82679e5) and [Walkthrough: Using Resources for Localization with ASP.NET](http://msdn.microsoft.com/Library/bb4e5b44-e2b0-48ab-bbe9-609fb33900b6).  \n  \n Requirements  \n  \n Win32  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Controls in Dialog Boxes](../mfc/controls-in-dialog-boxes.md)   \n [Controls](../mfc/controls-mfc.md)\n\n"}
