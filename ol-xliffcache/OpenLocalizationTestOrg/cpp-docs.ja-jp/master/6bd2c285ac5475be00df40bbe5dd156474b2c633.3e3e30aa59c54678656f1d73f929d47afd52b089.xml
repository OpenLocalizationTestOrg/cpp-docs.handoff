Blocks should be connected together using the `link_target` method on `ISource` blocks, which will invoke the `link_source` method on the corresponding target.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"process_input_messages\"></a>  target_block::process_input_messages Method  \n Processes messages that are received as inputs.  \n  \n```\nvirtual void process_input_messages(_Inout_ message<_Source_type>* _PMessage);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `_PMessage`  \n  \n##  <a name=\"process_message\"></a>  target_block::process_message Method  \n When overridden in a derived class, processes a message that was accepted by this `target_block` object.  \n  \n```\nvirtual void process_message(message<_Source_type> *);\n```  \n  \n##  <a name=\"propagate\"></a>  target_block::propagate Method  \n Asynchronously passes a message from a source block to this target block.  \n  \n```\nvirtual message_status propagate(\n    _Inout_opt_ message<_Source_type>* _PMessage,\n    _Inout_opt_ ISource<_Source_type>* _PSource);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `_PMessage`  \n A pointer to the `message` object.  \n  \n `_PSource`  \n A pointer to the source block offering the message.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n A [message_status](concurrency-namespace-enums.md) indication of what the target decided to do with the message.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The method throws an [invalid_argument](../../../standard-library/invalid-argument-class.md) exception if either the `_PMessage` or `_PSource` parameter is `NULL`.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"propagate_message\"></a>  target_block::propagate_message Method  \n When overridden in a derived class, this method asynchronously passes a message from an `ISource` block to this `target_block` object. It is invoked by the `propagate` method, when called by a source block.  \n  \n```\nvirtual message_status propagate_message(\n    _Inout_ message<_Source_type>* _PMessage,\n    _Inout_ ISource<_Source_type>* _PSource) = 0;\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `_PMessage`  \n A pointer to the `message` object.  \n  \n `_PSource`  \n A pointer to the source block offering the message.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n A [message_status](concurrency-namespace-enums.md) indication of what the target decided to do with the message.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"register_filter\"></a>  target_block::register_filter Method  \n Registers a filter method that will be invoked on every message received.  \n  \n```\nvoid register_filter(filter_method const& _Filter);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `_Filter`  \n The filter method.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"remove_sources\"></a>  target_block::remove_sources Method  \n Unlinks all sources after waiting for outstanding asynchronous send operations to complete.  \n  \n```\nvoid remove_sources();\n```  \n  \n### Remarks  \n All target blocks should call this routine to remove the sources in their destructor.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"send\"></a>  target_block::send Method  \n Synchronously passes a message from a source block to this target block.  \n  \n```\nvirtual message_status send(\n    _Inout_ message<_Source_type>* _PMessage,\n    _Inout_ ISource<_Source_type>* _PSource);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `_PMessage`  \n A pointer to the `message` object.  \n  \n `_PSource`  \n A pointer to the source block offering the message.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n A [message_status](concurrency-namespace-enums.md) indication of what the target decided to do with the message.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The method throws an [invalid_argument](../../../standard-library/invalid-argument-class.md) exception if either the `_PMessage` or `_PSource` parameter is `NULL`.  \n  \n Using the `send` method outside of message initiation and to propagate messages within a network is dangerous and can lead to deadlock.  \n  \n When `send` returns, the message has either already been accepted, and transferred into the target block, or it has been declined by the target.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"send_message\"></a>  target_block::send_message Method  \n When overridden in a derived class, this method synchronously passes a message from an `ISource` block to this `target_block` object. It is invoked by the `send` method, when called by a source block.  \n  \n```\nvirtual message_status send_message(\n    _Inout_ message<_Source_type> *,\n    _Inout_ ISource<_Source_type> *);\n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n A [message_status](concurrency-namespace-enums.md) indication of what the target decided to do with the message.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n By default, this block returns `declined` unless overridden by a derived class.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"sync_send\"></a>  target_block::sync_send Method  \n Synchronously send a message for processing.  \n  \n```\nvoid sync_send(_Inout_opt_ message<_Source_type>* _PMessage);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `_PMessage`  \n A pointer to the message being sent.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"ctor\"></a>  target_block::target_block Constructor  \n Constructs a `target_block` object.  \n  \n```\ntarget_block();\n```  \n  \n##  <a name=\"dtor\"></a>  target_block::~target_block Destructor  \n Destroys the `target_block` object.  \n  \n```\nvirtual ~target_block();\n```  \n  \n##  <a name=\"unlink_source\"></a>  target_block::unlink_source Method  \n Unlinks a specified source block from this `target_block` object.  \n  \n```\nvirtual void unlink_source(_Inout_ ISource<_Source_type>* _PSource);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `_PSource`  \n A pointer to the `ISource` block that is to be unlinked.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"unlink_sources\"></a>  target_block::unlink_sources Method  \n Unlinks all source blocks from this `target_block` object.  \n  \n```\nvirtual void unlink_sources();\n```  \n  \n##  <a name=\"wait_for_async_sends\"></a>  target_block::wait_for_async_sends Method  \n Waits for all asynchronous propagations to complete.  \n  \n```\nvoid wait_for_async_sends();\n```  \n  \n### Remarks  \n This method is used by message block destructors to ensure all asynchronous operations have had time to finish before destroying the block.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [concurrency Namespace](concurrency-namespace.md)   \n [ITarget Class](itarget-class.md)\n"}
