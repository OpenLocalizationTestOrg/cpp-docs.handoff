The class uses a lock on itself to ensure that accesses to its internal data are consistent for each thread.  The main application thread uses a lock on the same instance of the class to periodically check to see if any worker threads still exist, and waits to exit until all worker threads have completed their tasks.  \n  \n```  \n// msl_lock_release.cpp  \n// compile with: /clr  \n#include <msclr/lock.h>  \n  \nusing namespace System;  \nusing namespace System::Threading;  \nusing namespace msclr;  \n  \nref class CounterClass {  \nprivate:  \n   int Counter;     \n  \npublic:  \n   property int ThreadCount;  \n  \n   // function called by multiple threads, use lock to keep Counter consistent  \n   // for each thread  \n   void UseCounter() {  \n      try {  \n         lock l(this); // wait infinitely  \n  \n         Console::WriteLine(\"In thread {0}, Counter = {1}\", Thread::CurrentThread->ManagedThreadId,   \n            Counter);  \n  \n         for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {  \n            Counter++;  \n            Thread::Sleep(10);  \n         }  \n  \n         Console::WriteLine(\"In thread {0}, Counter = {1}\", Thread::CurrentThread->ManagedThreadId,   \n            Counter);  \n  \n         Counter = 0;  \n         // lock is automatically released when it goes out of scope and its destructor is called  \n      }  \n      catch (...) {  \n         Console::WriteLine(\"Couldn't acquire lock!\");  \n      }  \n  \n      ThreadCount--;  \n   }  \n};  \n  \nint main() {  \n   // create a few threads to contend for access to the shared data  \n   CounterClass^ cc = gcnew CounterClass;  \n   array<Thread^>^ tarr = gcnew array<Thread^>(5);  \n   ThreadStart^ startDelegate = gcnew ThreadStart(cc, &CounterClass::UseCounter);  \n   for (int i = 0; i < tarr->Length; i++) {  \n      tarr[i] = gcnew Thread(startDelegate);  \n      cc->ThreadCount++;  \n      tarr[i]->Start();  \n   }  \n  \n   // keep our main thread alive until all worker threads have completed  \n   lock l(cc, lock_later); // don't lock now, just create the object  \n   while (true) {  \n      if (l.try_acquire(50)) { // try to acquire lock, don't throw an exception if can't  \n         if (0 == cc->ThreadCount) {  \n            Console::WriteLine(\"All threads completed.\");  \n            break; // all threads are gone, exit while  \n         }  \n         else {  \n            Console::WriteLine(\"{0} threads exist, continue waiting...\", cc->ThreadCount);  \n            l.release(); // some threads exist, let them do their work  \n         }  \n      }  \n   }  \n}  \n```  \n  \n```Output  \nIn thread 3, Counter = 0  \nIn thread 3, Counter = 10  \nIn thread 5, Counter = 0  \nIn thread 5, Counter = 10  \nIn thread 7, Counter = 0  \nIn thread 7, Counter = 10  \nIn thread 4, Counter = 0  \nIn thread 4, Counter = 10  \nIn thread 6, Counter = 0  \nIn thread 6, Counter = 10  \nAll threads completed.  \n```  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Header file** \\<msclr\\lock.h>  \n  \n **Namespace** msclr  \n  \n## See Also  \n [lock Members](../dotnet/lock-members.md)   \n [lock::~lock](../dotnet/lock-tilde-lock.md)"}
