The primary difference between the two is that in C, declarations are allowed only at the start of a block; C++ adds the *declaration-statement*, which effectively removes this restriction. This enables you to introduce variables at a point in the program where a precomputed initialization value can be calculated.  \n  \n Declaring variables inside blocks also allows you to exercise precise control over the scope and lifetime of those variables.  \n  \n The topics on statements describe the following C++ keywords:  \n  \n|||||  \n|-|-|-|-|  \n|[break](../cpp/break-statement-cpp.md)|[else](../cpp/if-else-statement-cpp.md)|[__if_exists](../cpp/if-exists-statement.md)|[__try](../cpp/structured-exception-handling-c-cpp.md)|  \n|[case](../cpp/switch-statement-cpp.md)|[__except](../cpp/structured-exception-handling-c-cpp.md)|[__if_not_exists](../cpp/if-not-exists-statement.md)|[try](../cpp/try-throw-and-catch-statements-cpp.md)|  \n|[catch](../cpp/try-throw-and-catch-statements-cpp.md)|[for](../cpp/for-statement-cpp.md)|[__leave](../c-language/try-finally-statement-c.md)|[while](../cpp/while-statement-cpp.md)|  \n|[continue](../cpp/continue-statement-cpp.md)|[goto](../cpp/goto-statement-cpp.md)|[return](../cpp/return-statement-cpp.md)||  \n|[default](../cpp/switch-statement-cpp.md)|[__finally](../cpp/structured-exception-handling-c-cpp.md)|[switch](../cpp/switch-statement-cpp.md)||  \n|[do](../cpp/do-while-statement-cpp.md)|[if](../cpp/if-else-statement-cpp.md)|[throw](../cpp/try-throw-and-catch-statements-cpp.md)||  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Statements](../cpp/statements-cpp.md)"}
