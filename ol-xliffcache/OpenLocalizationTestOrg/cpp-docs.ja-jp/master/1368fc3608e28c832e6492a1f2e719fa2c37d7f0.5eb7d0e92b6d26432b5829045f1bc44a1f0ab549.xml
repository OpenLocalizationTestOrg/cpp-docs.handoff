The first example is noncompliant because the API specifies the following:  \n  \n \"An iteration of a loop with a `for` construct must not execute the same `ordered` directive more than once, and it must not execute more than one `ordered` directive.\" (See [Section 2.6.6](../../parallel/openmp/2-6-6-ordered-construct.md) on page 22)  \n  \n In this noncompliant example, all iterations execute 2 ordered sections:  \n  \n```  \n#pragma omp for ordered  \nfor (i=0; i<n; i++)   \n{  \n    ...  \n    #pragma omp ordered  \n    { ... }  \n    ...  \n    #pragma omp ordered  \n    { ... }  \n    ...  \n}  \n```  \n  \n The following compliant example shows a `for` with more than one ordered section:  \n  \n```  \n#pragma omp for ordered  \nfor (i=0; i<n; i++)   \n{  \n    ...  \n    if (i <= 10)   \n    {  \n        ...  \n        #pragma omp ordered  \n        { ... }  \n    }  \n    ...  \n    (i > 10)   \n    {  \n        ...  \n        #pragma omp ordered  \n        { ... }  \n    }  \n    ...  \n}  \n```"}
