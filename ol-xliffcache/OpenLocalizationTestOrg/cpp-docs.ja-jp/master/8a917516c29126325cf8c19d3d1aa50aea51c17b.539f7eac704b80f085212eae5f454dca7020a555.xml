MFC provides three Internet file classes ([CInternetFile](../mfc/reference/cinternetfile-class.md), [CHttpFile](../mfc/reference/chttpfile-class.md), and [CGopherFile](../mfc/reference/cgopherfile-class.md)) derived from the [CStdioFile](../mfc/reference/cstdiofile-class.md) class. Not only do these classes make retrieving and manipulating Internet data familiar to programmers who have used `CStdioFile` for local files, but with these classes you can handle local files and Internet files in a consistent, transparent manner.  \n  \n The MFC WinInet classes provide the same functionality as `CStdioFile` for data that is transferred across the Internet. These classes abstract the Internet protocols for HTTP, FTP, and gopher into a high-level application programming interface, providing a fast and straightforward path to making applications Internet-aware. For example, connecting to an FTP server still requires several steps at a low level, but as an MFC developer, you only need to make one call to `CInternetSession::GetFTPConnection` to create that connection.  \n  \n In addition, the MFC WinInet classes provide the following advantages:  \n  \n-   Buffered I/O  \n  \n-   Type-safe handles for your data  \n  \n-   Default parameters for many functions  \n  \n-   Exception handling for common Internet errors  \n  \n-   Automatic cleanup of open handles and connections  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Win32 Internet Extensions (WinInet)](../mfc/win32-internet-extensions-wininet.md)   \n [How WinInet Makes It Easier to Create Internet Client Applications](../mfc/how-wininet-makes-it-easier-to-create-internet-client-applications.md)\n\n"}
