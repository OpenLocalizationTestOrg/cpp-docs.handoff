The build process is controlled by the information in a project file (.vcxproj) that you can create and edit. The project file specifies build options based on build stages, conditions, and events.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n  \n|Term|Definition|  \n|----------|----------------|  \n|[MSBuild (Visual C++) Overview](../build/msbuild-visual-cpp-overview.md)|Describes how Visual C++ uses the **MSBuild** system.|  \n|[Build System Changes](../build/build-system-changes.md)|Discusses some of the differences between the current build system and the previous release.|  \n|[Walkthrough: Using MSBuild to Create a Visual C++ Project](../build/walkthrough-using-msbuild-to-create-a-visual-cpp-project.md)|Demonstrates how to create a Visual C++ project using **MSBuild**.|  \n|[How to: Use Build Events in MSBuild Projects](../build/how-to-use-build-events-in-msbuild-projects.md)|Demonstrates how to specify an action that occurs at a particuler stage in the build: before the build starts; before the link step starts; or after the build ends.|  \n|[How to: Add a Custom Build Step to MSBuild Projects](../build/how-to-add-a-custom-build-step-to-msbuild-projects.md)|Demonstrates how to add a user-defined stage to the build sequence.|  \n|[How to: Add Custom Build Tools to MSBuild Projects](../build/how-to-add-custom-build-tools-to-msbuild-projects.md)|Demonstrates how to associate a build tool with a particular file.|  \n|[How to: Integrate Custom Tools into the Project Properties](../build/how-to-integrate-custom-tools-into-the-project-properties.md)|Demonstrates how to add options for a custom tool to the project properties.|  \n|[How to: Modify the Target Framework and Platform Toolset](../build/how-to-modify-the-target-framework-and-platform-toolset.md)|Demonstrates how to compile a project for multiple frameworks or toolsets.|  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Building on the Command Line](../build/building-on-the-command-line.md)"}
