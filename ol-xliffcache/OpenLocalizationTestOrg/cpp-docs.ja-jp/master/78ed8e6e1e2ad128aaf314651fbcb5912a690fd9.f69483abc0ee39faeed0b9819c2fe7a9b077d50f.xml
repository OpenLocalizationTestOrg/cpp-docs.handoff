This method is not concurrency-safe.  \n  \n```\nvoid assign(\n    size_type _N,\n    const_reference _Item);\n\ntemplate<class _InputIterator>\nvoid assign(_InputIterator _Begin,\n    _InputIterator _End);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `_InputIterator`  \n The type of the specified iterator.  \n  \n `_N`  \n The number of items to copy into the concurrent vector.  \n  \n `_Item`  \n Reference to a value used to fill the concurrent vector.  \n  \n `_Begin`  \n An iterator to the first element of the source range.  \n  \n `_End`  \n An iterator to one past the last element of the source range.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n `assign` is not concurrency-safe. You must ensure that no other threads are invoking methods on the concurrent vector when you call this method.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"at\"></a>  concurrent_vector::at Method  \n Provides access to the element at the given index in the concurrent vector. This method is concurrency-safe for read operations, and also while growing the vector, as long as you have ensured that the value `_Index` is less than the size of the concurrent vector.  \n  \n```\nreference at(size_type _Index);\n\nconst_reference at(size_type _Index) const;\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `_Index`  \n The index of the element to be retrieved.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n A reference to the item at the given index.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The version of the function `at` that returns a non- `const` reference cannot be used to concurrently write to the element from different threads. A different synchronization object should be used to synchronize concurrent read and write operations to the same data element.  \n  \n The method throws `out_of_range` if `_Index` is greater than or equal to the size of the concurrent vector, and `range_error` if the index is for a broken portion of the vector. For details on how a vector can become broken, see [Parallel Containers and Objects](../../../parallel/concrt/parallel-containers-and-objects.md).  \n  \n##  <a name=\"back\"></a>  concurrent_vector::back Method  \n Returns a reference or a `const` reference to the last element in the concurrent vector. If the concurrent vector is empty, the return value is undefined. This method is concurrency-safe.  \n  \n```\nreference back();\n\nconst_reference back() const;\n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n A reference or a `const` reference to the last element in the concurrent vector.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"begin\"></a>  concurrent_vector::begin Method  \n Returns an iterator of type `iterator` or `const_iterator` to the beginning of the concurrent vector. This method is concurrency-safe.  \n  \n```\niterator begin();\n\nconst_iterator begin() const;\n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n An iterator of type `iterator` or `const_iterator` to the beginning of the concurrent vector.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"capacity\"></a>  concurrent_vector::capacity Method  \n Returns the maximum size to which the concurrent vector can grow without having to allocate more memory. This method is concurrency-safe.  \n  \n```\nsize_type capacity() const;\n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n The maximum size to which the concurrent vector can grow without having to allocate more memory.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n Unlike an STL `vector`, a `concurrent_vector` object does not move existing elements if it allocates more memory.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cbegin\"></a>  concurrent_vector::cbegin Method  \n Returns an iterator of type `const_iterator` to the beginning of the concurrent vector. This method is concurrency-safe.  \n  \n```\nconst_iterator cbegin() const;\n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n An iterator of type `const_iterator` to the beginning of the concurrent vector.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cend\"></a>  concurrent_vector::cend Method  \n Returns an iterator of type `const_iterator` to the end of the concurrent vector. This method is concurrency-safe.  \n  \n```\nconst_iterator cend() const;\n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n An iterator of type `const_iterator` to the end of the concurrent vector.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"clear\"></a>  concurrent_vector::clear Method  \n Erases all elements in the concurrent vector. This method is not concurrency-safe.  \n  \n```\nvoid clear();\n```  \n  \n### Remarks  \n `clear` is not concurrency-safe. You must ensure that no other threads are invoking methods on the concurrent vector when you call this method. `clear` does not free internal arrays. To free internal arrays, call the function `shrink_to_fit` after `clear`.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"ctor\"></a>  concurrent_vector::concurrent_vector Constructor  \n Constructs a concurrent vector.  \n  \n```\nexplicit concurrent_vector(\n    const allocator_type& _Al = allocator_type());\n\nconcurrent_vector(\n    const concurrent_vector& _Vector);\n\ntemplate<class M>\nconcurrent_vector(\n    const concurrent_vector<T,\n    M>& _Vector,\n    const allocator_type& _Al = allocator_type());\n\nconcurrent_vector(\n    concurrent_vector&& _Vector);\n\nexplicit concurrent_vector(\n    size_type _N);\n\nconcurrent_vector(\n    size_type _N,\n    const_reference _Item,\n    const allocator_type& _Al = allocator_type());\n\ntemplate<class _InputIterator>\nconcurrent_vector(_InputIterator _Begin,\n    _InputIterator _End,\n    const allocator_type& _Al = allocator_type());\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `M`  \n The allocator type of the source vector.  \n  \n `_InputIterator`  \n The type of the input iterator.  \n  \n `_Al`  \n The allocator class to use with this object.  \n  \n `_Vector`  \n The source `concurrent_vector` object to copy or move elements from.  \n  \n `_N`  \n The initial capacity of the `concurrent_vector` object.  \n  \n `_Item`  \n The value of elements in the constructed object.  \n  \n `_Begin`  \n Position of the first element in the range of elements to be copied.  \n  \n `_End`  \n Position of the first element beyond the range of elements to be copied.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n All constructors store an allocator object `_Al` and initialize the vector.  \n  \n The first constructor specify an empty initial vector and explicitly specifies the allocator type. to be used.  \n  \n The second and third constructors specify a copy of the concurrent vector `_Vector`.  \n  \n The fourth constructor specifies a move of the concurrent vector `_Vector`.  \n  \n The fifth constructor specifies a repetition of a specified number ( `_N`) of elements of the default value for class `T`.  \n  \n The sixth constructor specifies a repetition of ( `_N`) elements of value `_Item`.  \n  \n The last constructor specifies values supplied by the iterator range [ `_Begin`, `_End`).  \n  \n##  <a name=\"dtor\"></a>  concurrent_vector::~concurrent_vector Destructor  \n Erases all elements and destroys this concurrent vector.  \n  \n```\n~concurrent_vector();\n```  \n  \n##  <a name=\"crbegin\"></a>  concurrent_vector::crbegin Method  \n Returns an iterator of type `const_reverse_iterator` to the beginning of the concurrent vector.

If the size of the container is larger than the requested size, the elements closest to the end of the container are deleted until the container reaches the size `_N`. If the present size of the container is the same as the requested size, no action is taken.  \n  \n `resize` is not concurrency safe. You must ensure that no other threads are invoking methods on the concurrent vector when you call this method.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"shrink_to_fit\"></a>  concurrent_vector::shrink_to_fit Method  \n Compacts the internal representation of the concurrent vector to reduce fragmentation and optimize memory usage. This method is not concurrency-safe.  \n  \n```\nvoid shrink_to_fit();\n```  \n  \n### Remarks  \n This method will internally re-allocate memory move elements around, invalidating all the iterators. `shrink_to_fit` is not concurrency-safe.

However, it may also include elements that are allocated but still under construction by concurrent calls to any of the growth methods.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"swap\"></a>  concurrent_vector::swap Method  \n Swaps the contents of two concurrent vectors. This method is not concurrency-safe.  \n  \n```\nvoid swap(concurrent_vector& _Vector);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `_Vector`  \n The `concurrent_vector` object to swap contents with.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [concurrency Namespace](concurrency-namespace.md)   \n [Parallel Containers and Objects](../../../parallel/concrt/parallel-containers-and-objects.md)\n\n\n\n"}
