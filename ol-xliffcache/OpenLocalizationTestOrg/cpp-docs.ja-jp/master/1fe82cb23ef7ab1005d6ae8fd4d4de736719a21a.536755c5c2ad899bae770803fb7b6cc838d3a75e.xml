This routine is called **_setargv** and is described in [Wildcard Expansion](../cpp/wildcard-expansion.md). To suppress its use, define a routine that does nothing in the file containing the **main** function, and name it **_setargv**. The call to **_setargv** is then satisfied by your definition of **_setargv**, and the library version is not loaded.  \n  \n Similarly, if you never access the environment table through the `envp` argument, you can provide your own empty routine to be used in place of **_setenvp**, the environment-processing routine. Just as with the **_setargv** function, **_setenvp** must be declared as **extern \"C\"**.  \n  \n Your program might make calls to the **spawn** or `exec` family of routines in the C run-time library. If this is the case, you should not suppress the environment-processing routine, since this routine is used to pass an environment from the parent process to the child process.  \n  \n## END Microsoft Specific  \n  \n## See Also  \n [main: Program Startup](../cpp/main-program-startup.md)"}
