Items are popped in priority order where priority is determined by a functor supplied as a template argument.  \n  \n## Syntax  \n  \n```\ntemplate <typename T,\n    typename _Compare= std::less<T>,\n    typename _Ax = std::allocator<T>\n>,\n    typename _Ax = std::allocator<T>> class concurrent_priority_queue;\n```  \n  \n#### Parameters  \n `T`  \n The data type of the elements to be stored in the priority queue.  \n  \n `_Compare`  \n The type of the function object that can compare two element values as sort keys to determine their relative order in the priority queue. This argument is optional and the binary predicate `less<``T``>` is the default value.  \n  \n `_Ax`  \n The type that represents the stored allocator object that encapsulates details about the allocation and deallocation of memory for the concurrent priority queue. This argument is optional and the default value is `allocator<``T``>`.  \n  \n## Members  \n  \n### Public Typedefs  \n  \n|Name|Description|  \n|----------|-----------------|  \n|`allocator_type`|A type that represents the allocator class for the concurrent priority queue.|  \n|`const_reference`|A type that represents a const reference to an element of the type stored in a concurrent priority queue.|  \n|`reference`|A type that represents a reference to an element of the type stored in a concurrent priority queue.|  \n|`size_type`|A type that counts the number of elements in a concurrent priority queue.|  \n|`value_type`|A type that represents the data type stored in a concurrent priority queue.|  \n  \n### Public Constructors  \n  \n|Name|Description|  \n|----------|-----------------|  \n|[concurrent_priority_queue::concurrent_priority_queue Constructor](#ctor)|Overloaded.
