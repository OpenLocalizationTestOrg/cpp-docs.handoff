# EVEN and ALIGN Directives
## Microsoft Specific  
 Although the inline assembler doesn't support most MASM directives, it does support `EVEN` and **ALIGN**. These directives put **NOP** (no operation) instructions in the assembly code as needed to align labels to specific boundaries. This makes instruction-fetch operations more efficient for some processors.
