you discovered when you tested the project.  \n  \n## Prerequisites  \n  \n-   This walkthrough assumes that you understand the fundamentals of the C++ language.  \n  \n-   It also assumes that you have completed the earlier related walkthroughs that are listed in [Using the Visual Studio IDE for C++ Desktop Development](../ide/using-the-visual-studio-ide-for-cpp-desktop-development.md).  \n  \n### To fix a program that has a bug  \n  \n1.  To see what occurs when a `Cardgame` object is destroyed, view the destructor for the `Cardgame` class.  \n  \n     On the menu bar, choose **View**, **Class View**.  \n  \n     In the **Class View** window, expand the **Game** project tree and select the **Cardgame** class to display the class members and methods.  \n  \n     Open the shortcut menu for the **~Cardgame(void)** destructor and then choose **Go To Definition**.  \n  \n2.  To decrease the `totalParticipants` when a Cardgame terminates, add the following code between the opening and closing braces of the `Cardgame::~Cardgame` destructor.  \n  \n     [!code-cpp[NVC_Walkthrough_Debugging_A_Project#110](../ide/codesnippet/CPP/walkthrough-debugging-a-project-cpp_1.cpp)]  \n  \n3.  The Cardgame.cpp file should resemble this after you change it:  \n  \n     [!code-cpp[NVC_Walkthrough_Debugging_A_Project#111](../ide/codesnippet/CPP/walkthrough-debugging-a-project-cpp_2.cpp)]  \n  \n4.  On the menu bar, choose **Build**, **Build Solution**.  \n  \n5.  When the build completes, run it in Debug mode by choosing **Debug**, **Start Debugging** on the menu bar, or by choosing the F5 key. The program pauses at the first breakpoint.  \n  \n6.  To step through the program, on the menu bar, choose **Debug**, **Step Over**, or choose the F10 key.  \n  \n     Notice that after each Cardgame constructor executes, the value of `totalParticipants` increases. When the `PlayGames` function returns, as each Cardgame instance goes out of scope and is deleted (and the destructor is called), `totalParticipants` decreases. Just before the `return` statement is executed, `totalParticipants` equals 0.  \n  \n7.  Continue stepping through the program until it exits, or let it run by choosing **Debug**, **Run** on the menu bar, or by choosing the F5 key.  \n  \n## Next Steps  \n **Previous:** [Walkthrough: Testing a Project (C++)](../ide/walkthrough-testing-a-project-cpp.md) &#124; **Next:**[Walkthrough: Deploying Your Program (C++)](../ide/walkthrough-deploying-your-program-cpp.md)  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Visual C++ Guided Tour](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/499cb66f-7df1-45d6-8b6b-33d94fd1f17c)   \n [DELETE_PENDING_Building and Debugging](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/9f6ba537-5ea0-46fb-b6ba-b63d657d84f1)"}
