Specify the name of the new class, select the base class, and select the ID of the dialog box with which it is associated (if any). The code wizard creates a header file and an implementation file and adds them to your project.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  You can add MFC classes to an ATL COM application if you initially [created the application with MFC support](../../atl/reference/mfc-support-in-atl-projects.md). You can also add MFC classes to Win32 projects that have MFC support.  \n  \n### To add an MFC class to your project  \n  \n1.  From Class View, right-click the project name. Click **Add** and then click **Add Class** to open the [Add Class](../../ide/add-class-dialog-box.md) dialog box.  \n  \n2.  In the Templates pane, select **MFC Class** and press the **Add** button.  \n  \n3.  Define the settings for the new class in the [MFC Class Wizard](../../mfc/reference/mfc-add-class-wizard.md) dialog box.  \n  \n4.  Click **Finish** to close the wizard and view the new class in Class View. You can also view the files created by the wizard in **Solution Explorer**.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Adding Functionality with Code Wizards](../../ide/adding-functionality-with-code-wizards-cpp.md)   \n [Adding a Class](../../ide/adding-a-class-visual-cpp.md)   \n [Class Overview](../../mfc/class-library-overview.md)\n\n"}
