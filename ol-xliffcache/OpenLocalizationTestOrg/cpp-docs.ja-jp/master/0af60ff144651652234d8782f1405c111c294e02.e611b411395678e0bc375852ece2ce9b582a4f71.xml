To override them, you declare an overriding function in your derived dialog class using the [Properties window](/visualstudio/ide/reference/properties-window).  \n  \n `OnInitDialog` is called just before the dialog box is displayed. You must call the default `OnInitDialog` handler from your override — usually as the first action in the handler. By default, `OnInitDialog` returns **TRUE** to indicate that the focus should be set to the first control in the dialog box.  \n  \n `OnOK` is typically overridden for modeless but not modal dialog boxes. If you override this handler for a modal dialog box, call the base class version from your override — to ensure that `EndDialog` is called — or call `EndDialog` yourself.  \n  \n `OnCancel` is usually overridden for modeless dialog boxes.  \n  \n For more information about these member functions, see class [CDialog](../mfc/reference/cdialog-class.md) in the *MFC Reference* and the discussion on [Life Cycle of a Dialog Box](../mfc/life-cycle-of-a-dialog-box.md).  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Dialog Boxes](../mfc/dialog-boxes.md)   \n [Commonly Added Member Functions](../mfc/commonly-added-member-functions.md)\n"}
