You can draw freehand or draw using shapes. You can select parts of an image for editing, flipping or resizing, or you can create a custom brush from a selected part of an image and draw with that brush. You can define image properties, save images in different formats, and convert images from one format to another.  \n  \n In addition to creating new graphical resources, you can [import existing images](../windows/how-to-import-and-export-resources.md) for editing and then add them to your project. You can also open and edit images that are not part of a project for [stand-alone image editing](../mfc/editing-an-image-outside-of-a-project-image-editor-for-icons.md).  \n  \n-   [Creating a New Bitmap or Other Image](../mfc/creating-an-icon-or-other-image-image-editor-for-icons.md)  \n  \n-   [Selecting and Using a Drawing Tool](../mfc/using-a-drawing-tool-image-editor-for-icons.md)  \n  \n-   [Drawing Lines or Closed Figures](../mfc/drawing-lines-or-closed-figures-image-editor-for-icons.md)  \n  \n-   [Selecting an Area of an Image](../mfc/selecting-an-area-of-an-image-image-editor-for-icons.md)  \n  \n-   [Editing Selected Parts of an Image](../mfc/editing-parts-of-an-image-image-editor-for-icons.md)  \n  \n-   [Flipping an Image](../mfc/flipping-an-image-image-editor-for-icons.md)  \n  \n-   [Resizing an Image](../mfc/resizing-an-image-image-editor-for-icons.md)  \n  \n-   [Creating a Custom Brush](../mfc/creating-a-custom-brush-image-editor-for-icons.md)  \n  \n-   [Changing Image Properties](../mfc/changing-image-properties-image-editor-for-icons.md)  \n  \n-   [Saving Bitmaps as .gifs or .jpegs](../mfc/saving-bitmaps-as-gifs-or-jpegs-image-editor-for-icons.md)  \n  \n-   [Converting an Image From One Format to Another](../mfc/converting-an-image-from-one-format-to-another-image-editor-for-icons.md)  \n  \n-   [Editing an Image Outside of a Project](../mfc/editing-an-image-outside-of-a-project-image-editor-for-icons.md)  \n  \n-   [Image Menu](../mfc/image-menu-image-editor-for-icons.md)  \n  \n-   [Image Editor Toolbar](../mfc/toolbar-image-editor-for-icons.md)  \n  \n-   [Image Editor Window Panes](../mfc/window-panes-image-editor-for-icons.md)  \n  \n For information on adding resources to managed projects, please see [Resources in Applications](http://msdn.microsoft.com/Library/8ad495d4-2941-40cf-bf64-e82e85825890) in the *.NET Framework Developer's Guide.* For information on manually adding resource files to managed projects, accessing resources, displaying static resources, and assigning resources strings to properties, see [Walkthrough: Localizing Windows Forms](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/9a96220d-a19b-4de0-9f48-01e5d82679e5) and [Walkthrough: Using Resources for Localization with ASP.NET](http://msdn.microsoft.com/Library/bb4e5b44-e2b0-48ab-bbe9-609fb33900b6).  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  Using the Image Editor, you can view 32-bit images, but you cannot edit them.  \n  \n## Requirements  \n None  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Accelerator Keys](../mfc/accelerator-keys-image-editor-for-icons.md)   \n [Image Editor for Icons](../mfc/image-editor-for-icons.md)   \n\n"}
