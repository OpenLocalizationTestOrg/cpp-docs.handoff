\n  \n## Syntax  \n  \n```  \n#pragma omp parallel [clauses]  \n{  \n   code_block  \n}  \n```  \n  \n## Remarks  \n where,  \n  \n `clause` (optional)  \n Zero or more clauses.  See the Remarks section for a list of the clauses supported by **parallel**.  \n  \n## Remarks  \n The **parallel** directive supports the following OpenMP clauses:  \n  \n-   [copyin](../../../parallel/openmp/reference/copyin.md)  \n  \n-   [default](../../../parallel/openmp/reference/default-openmp.md)  \n  \n-   [firstprivate](../../../parallel/openmp/reference/firstprivate.md)  \n  \n-   [if](../../../parallel/openmp/reference/if-openmp.md)  \n  \n-   [num_threads](../../../parallel/openmp/reference/num-threads.md)  \n  \n-   [private](../../../parallel/openmp/reference/private-openmp.md)  \n  \n-   [reduction](../../../parallel/openmp/reference/reduction.md)  \n  \n-   [shared](../../../parallel/openmp/reference/shared-openmp.md)  \n  \n **parallel** can also be used with the [sections](../../../parallel/openmp/reference/sections-openmp.md) and [for](../../../parallel/openmp/reference/for-openmp.md) directives.  \n  \n For more information, see [2.3 parallel Construct](../../../parallel/openmp/2-3-parallel-construct.md).  \n  \n## Example  \n The following sample shows how to set the number of threads and define a parallel region. By default, the number of threads is equal to the number of logical processors on the machine. For example, if you have a machine with one physical processor that has hyperthreading enabled, it will have two logical processors and, therefore, two threads.  \n  \n```  \n// omp_parallel.cpp  \n// compile with: /openmp   \n#include <stdio.h>  \n#include <omp.h>  \n  \nint main() {  \n   #pragma omp parallel num_threads(4)  \n   {  \n      int i = omp_get_thread_num();  \n      printf_s(\"Hello from thread %d\\n\", i);  \n   }  \n}  \n```  \n  \n```Output  \nHello from thread 0  \nHello from thread 1  \nHello from thread 2  \nHello from thread 3  \n```  \n  \n## Comment  \n Note that the order of output can vary on different machines.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Directives](../../../parallel/openmp/reference/openmp-directives.md)"}
