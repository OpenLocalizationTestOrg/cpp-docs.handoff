The appropriate information for parsing the templates is obtained by directly accessing the wizard control's symbol table.  \n  \n The following example is a very simple template file for a wizard that asks the user to select either A or B.  \n  \n## Example  \n  \n```  \nThis file has been created by My Custom wizard.  \nYou selected:  \n[!if TYPE_A]  \nType A  \n[!else]  \nType B  \n[!endif]  \nThe name of this project is [!output PROJECT_NAME].root.cpp:  \n```  \n  \n If the user chooses Type B, the above template would be rendered as follows:  \n  \n```Output  \nThis file has been created by My Custom wizard.  \nYou selected:  \nType B  \nThe name of this project is MyApp8.  \n```  \n  \n## Output  \n  \n```  \nThis file has been created by My Custom wizard.  \nYou selected:  \nType B  \nThe name of this project is MyApp8.  \n```  \n  \n **Note** The syntax above is new to Visual C++ .NET. Syntax from previous versions of Visual C++ is not supported in Visual C++ .NET.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Files Created for Your Wizard](../ide/files-created-for-your-wizard.md)   \n [Custom Wizard](../ide/custom-wizard.md)   \n [Creating a Custom Wizard](../ide/creating-a-custom-wizard.md)   \n [Designing a Wizard](../ide/designing-a-wizard.md)   \n [Templates.inf File](../ide/templates-inf-file.md)"}
