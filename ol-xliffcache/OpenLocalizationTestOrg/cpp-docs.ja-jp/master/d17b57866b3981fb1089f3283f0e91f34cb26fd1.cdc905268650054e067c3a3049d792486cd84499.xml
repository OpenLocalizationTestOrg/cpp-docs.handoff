This family of articles explains how to open and close files as well as read and write data to those files. It also discusses file status operations. For a description of how to use the object-based serialization features of MFC as an alternative way of reading and writing data in files, see the article [Serialization](../mfc/serialization-in-mfc.md).  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  When you use MFC **CDocument** objects, the framework does much of the serialization work for you. In particular, the framework creates and uses the `CFile` object. You only have to write code in your override of the `Serialize` member function of class **CDocument**.  \n  \n The `CFile` class provides an interface for general-purpose binary file operations. The `CStdioFile` and `CMemFile` classes derived from `CFile` and the `CSharedFile` class derived from `CMemFile` supply more specialized file services.  \n  \n For more information about alternatives to MFC file handling, see [File Handling](../c-runtime-library/file-handling.md) in the *Run-Time Library Reference*.  \n  \n For information about derived `CFile` classes, see the [MFC hierarchy chart](../mfc/hierarchy-chart.md).  \n  \n## What do you want to do  \n *Use CFile*  \n  \n-   [Open a file with CFile](../mfc/opening-files.md)  \n  \n-   [Read and write a file with CFile](../mfc/reading-and-writing-files.md)  \n  \n-   [Close a file with CFile](../mfc/closing-files.md)  \n  \n-   [Access file status with CFile](../mfc/accessing-file-status.md)  \n  \n *Use MFC Serialization (Object Persistence)*  \n  \n-   [Create a serializable class](../mfc/serialization-making-a-serializable-class.md)  \n  \n-   [Serialize an object via a CArchive object](../mfc/serialization-serializing-an-object.md)  \n  \n-   [Create a CArchive object](../mfc/two-ways-to-create-a-carchive-object.md)  \n  \n-   [Use CArchive <\\< and >> operators](../mfc/using-the-carchive-output-and-input-operators.md)  \n  \n-   [Store and load CObjects and CObject-derived objects via an archive](../mfc/storing-and-loading-cobjects-via-an-archive.md)  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Concepts](../mfc/mfc-concepts.md)   \n [General MFC Topics](../mfc/general-mfc-topics.md)   \n [CArchive Class](../mfc/reference/carchive-class.md)   \n [CObject Class](../mfc/reference/cobject-class.md)\n"}
