Symbol tables exist in all object files. A COFF symbol table appears in an image file only if it is linked with /DEBUG.  \n  \n The following is a description of the output for /SYMBOLS. Additional information on the meaning of /SYMBOLS output can be found by looking in winnt.h (IMAGE_SYMBOL and IMAGE_AUX_SYMBOL), or COFF documentation.  \n  \n Given the following sample dump:  \n  \n```  \nDump of file main.obj  \nFile Type: COFF OBJECT  \n  \nCOFF    SYMBOL    TABLE  \n000    00000000   DEBUG      notype      Filename      | .file  \n      main.cpp  \n002   000B1FDB   ABS      notype      Static      | @comp.id  \n003   00000000   SECT1      notype      Static      | .drectve  \n      Section length       26, #relocs   0, #linenums    0, checksum 722C964F  \n005   00000000   SECT2      notype      Static      | .text  \n      Section length      23, #relocs      1, #linenums    0, checksum 459FF65F, selection    1 (pick no duplicates)  \n007   00000000   SECT2      notype ()   External      | _main  \n008   00000000   UNDEF      notype ()   External      | ?MyDump@@YAXXZ (void __cdecl MyDump(void))  \n  \nString Table Size = 0x10 bytes  \n  \nSummary  \n  \n      26 .drectve  \n      23 .text  \n```  \n  \n## Remarks  \n The following description, for lines that begin with a symbol number, describes columns that have information relevant to users:  \n  \n-   The first three-digit number is the symbol index/number.  \n  \n-   If the third column contains SECT*x*, the symbol is defined in that section of the object file. But if UNDEF appears, it is not defined in that object and must be resolved elsewhere.  \n  \n-   The fifth column (Static, External) tells whether the symbol is visible only within that object, or whether it is public (visible externally). A Static symbol, _sym, wouldn't be linked to a Public symbol _sym; these would be two different instances of functions named _sym.  \n  \n The last column in a numbered line is the symbol name, both decorated and undecorated.  \n  \n Only the [/HEADERS](../../build/reference/headers.md) DUMPBIN option is available for use on files produced with the [/GL](../../build/reference/gl-whole-program-optimization.md) compiler option.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [DUMPBIN Options](../../build/reference/dumpbin-options.md)"}
