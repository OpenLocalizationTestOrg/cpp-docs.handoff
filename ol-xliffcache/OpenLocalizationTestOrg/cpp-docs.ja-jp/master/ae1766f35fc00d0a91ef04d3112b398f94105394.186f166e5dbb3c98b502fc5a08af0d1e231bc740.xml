Each section is executed once by a thread in the team. The syntax of the **sections** directive is as follows:  \n  \n```  \n#pragma omp sections [clause[[,] clause] ...] new-line  \n   {  \n   [#pragma omp section new-line]  \n      structured-block  \n   [#pragma omp section new-linestructured-block ]  \n...  \n}  \n```  \n  \n The clause is one of the following:  \n  \n **private(** *variable-list* **)**  \n  \n **firstprivate(** *variable-list* **)**  \n  \n **lastprivate(** *variable-list* **)**  \n  \n **reduction(** *operator* **:**  *variable-list* **)**  \n  \n **nowait**  \n  \n Each section is preceded by a **section** directive, although the **section** directive is optional for the first section. The **section** directives must appear within the lexical extent of the **sections** directive. There is an implicit barrier at the end of a **sections** construct, unless a **nowait** is specified.  \n  \n Restrictions to the **sections** directive are as follows:  \n  \n-   A **section** directive must not appear outside the lexical extent of the **sections** directive.  \n  \n-   Only a single **nowait** clause can appear on a **sections** directive.  \n  \n## Cross References:  \n  \n-   **private**, **firstprivate**, **lastprivate**, and **reduction** clauses, see [Section 2.7.2](../../parallel/openmp/2-7-2-data-sharing-attribute-clauses.md) on page 25."}
