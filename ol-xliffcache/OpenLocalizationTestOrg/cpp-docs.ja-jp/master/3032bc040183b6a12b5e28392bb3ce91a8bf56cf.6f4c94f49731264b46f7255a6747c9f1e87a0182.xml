They commonly appear in dialog boxes or on toolbars. This topic family covers three main kinds of controls:  \n  \n-   Windows common controls, including owner-drawn controls  \n  \n-   ActiveX Controls  \n  \n-   Other control classes supplied by the Microsoft Foundation Class Library (MFC)  \n  \n## Windows Common Controls  \n The Windows operating system has always provided a number of Windows common controls. These control objects are programmable, and the Visual C++ dialog editor supports adding them to your dialog boxes. The Microsoft Foundation Class Library (MFC) supplies classes that encapsulate each of these controls, as shown in the table [Windows Common Controls and MFC Classes](#_core_windows_common_controls_and_mfc_classes). (Some items in the table have related topics that describe them further. For controls that lack topics, see the documentation for the MFC class.)  \n  \n Class [CWnd](../mfc/reference/cwnd-class.md) is the base class of all window classes, including all of the control classes. The Windows common controls are supported in the following environments:  \n  \n-   Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows 2000  \n  \n-   Windows NT, version 3.51 and later  \n  \n-   Win32s, version 1.3 (Visual C++ versions 4.2 and later do not support Win32s)  \n  \n The older common controls — check boxes, combo boxes, edit boxes, list boxes, option buttons, pushbuttons, scroll bar controls, and static controls — were available in earlier versions of Windows as well.  \n  \n## ActiveX Controls  \n ActiveX controls, formerly known as OLE controls, can be used in dialog boxes in your applications for Windows, or in HTML pages on the World Wide Web. For more information, see [MFC ActiveX Controls](../mfc/mfc-activex-controls.md).  \n  \n## Other MFC Control Classes  \n In addition to classes that encapsulate all of the Windows common controls and that support programming your own ActiveX controls (or using ActiveX controls supplied by others), MFC supplies the following control classes of its own:  \n  \n-   [CBitmapButton](../mfc/reference/cbitmapbutton-class.md)  \n  \n-   [CCheckListBox](../mfc/reference/cchecklistbox-class.md)  \n  \n-   [CDragListBox](../mfc/reference/cdraglistbox-class.md)  \n  \n##  <a name=\"_core_finding_information_about_windows_common_controls\"></a> Finding Information About Windows Common Controls  \n The table below briefly describes each of the Windows common controls, including the control's MFC wrapper class.  \n  \n### <a name=\"_core_windows_common_controls_and_mfc_classes\"></a>  Windows Common Controls and MFC Classes  \n  \n|Control|MFC class|Description|New in Windows 95|  \n|-------------|---------------|-----------------|------------------------|  \n|[animation](../mfc/using-canimatectrl.md)|[CAnimateCtrl](../mfc/reference/canimatectrl-class.md)|Displays successive frames of an AVI video clip|Yes|  \n|button|[CButton](../mfc/reference/cbutton-class.md)|Pushbuttons that cause an action;
