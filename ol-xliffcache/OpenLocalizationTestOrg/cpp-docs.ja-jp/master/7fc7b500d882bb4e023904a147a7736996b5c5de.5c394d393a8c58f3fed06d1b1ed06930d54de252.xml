If the input tasks are of type `void` the output task will also be a `task<void>`.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n If both of the tasks are canceled or throw exceptions, the returned task will complete in the canceled state, and one of the exceptions, if any are encountered, will be thrown when you call `get()` or `wait()` on that task.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"operator_amp_amp\"></a>  operator&amp;&amp; Operator  \n Creates a task that will complete succesfully when both of the tasks supplied as arguments complete successfully.  \n  \n```  \ntemplate<\n    typename _ReturnType  \n>  \ntask<std::vector<_ReturnType>>    operator&&(\n    const task<_ReturnType>& _Lhs,  \n    const task<_ReturnType>& _Rhs);\n\n \ntemplate<\n    typename _ReturnType  \n>  \ntask<std::vector<_ReturnType>>    operator&&(\n    const task<std::vector<_ReturnType>>& _Lhs,  \n    const task<_ReturnType>& _Rhs);\n\n \ntemplate<\n    typename _ReturnType  \n>  \ntask<std::vector<_ReturnType>>    operator&&(\n    const task<_ReturnType>& _Lhs,  \n    const task<std::vector<_ReturnType>>& _Rhs);\n\n \ntemplate<\n    typename _ReturnType  \n>  \ntask<std::vector<_ReturnType>>    operator&&(\n    const task<std::vector<_ReturnType>>& _Lhs,  \n    const task<std::vector<_ReturnType>>& _Rhs);\n\n \ninline task<void>    operator&&(\n    const task<void>& _Lhs,  \n    const task<void>& _Rhs);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `_ReturnType`  \n The type of the returned task.  \n  \n `_Lhs`  \n The first task to combine into the resulting task.  \n  \n `_Rhs`  \n The second task to combine into the resulting task.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n A task that completes successfully when both of the input tasks have completed successfully.
