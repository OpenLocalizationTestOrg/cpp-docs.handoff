Specify the command file using the following syntax:  \n  \n```  \nBSCMAKE @filename  \n```  \n  \n Only one command file is allowed. You can specify a path with *filename*. Precede *filename* with an at sign (@). BSCMAKE does not assume an extension. You can specify additional *sbrfiles* on the command line after *filename*. The command file is a text file that contains the input to BSCMAKE in the same order as you would specify it on the command line. Separate the command-line arguments with one or more spaces, tabs, or newline characters.  \n  \n The following command calls BSCMAKE using a command file:  \n  \n```  \nBSCMAKE @prog1.txt  \n```  \n  \n The following is a sample command file:  \n  \n```  \n/n /v /o main.bsc /El  \n/S (  \ntoolbox.h  \nverdate.h c:\\src\\inc\\screen.h  \n)  \nfile1.sbr file2.sbr file3.sbr file4.sbr  \n```  \n  \n## See Also  \n [BSCMAKE Reference](../../build/reference/bscmake-reference.md)"}
