In addition, there are wizards that help you write your program. These implementations are described in [OLE DB Templates, Attributes, and Other Implementations](../../data/oledb/ole-db-templates-attributes-and-other-implementations.md).  \n  \n **Do you need to write your own provider?**  \n Most developers do not need to write their own provider. Microsoft provides several providers. Whenever you create a data connection (for example, when you add a consumer to your project using the ATL OLE DB Consumer Wizard), the **Data Link Properties** dialog box lists all the available providers registered on your system. If one of these providers is appropriate for your own data store and data access application, the easiest thing to do is use one of these. However, if your data store does not fit one of these categories, you have to create your own provider. For information about creating providers, see [OLE DB Provider Templates](../../data/oledb/ole-db-provider-templates-cpp.md).  \n  \n **What level of support do you need for your consumer?**  \n Some consumers can be very basic; while others can be very complex. The functionality of OLE DB objects is specified by properties. When you use the ATL OLE DB Consumer Wizard to create a consumer or the Database Provider Wizard to create a provider, it sets the appropriate object properties for you to give you a standard set of functionalities. However, if the wizard-generated consumer or provider classes do not support everything you need them to do, you need to refer to the interfaces for those classes in the [OLE DB Templates Library](../../data/oledb/ole-db-templates.md). These interfaces wrap the raw OLE DB interfaces, providing extra implementation to make using them easier for you.  \n  \n For example, if you want to update data in a rowset, but forgot to specify this when you created the consumer with the wizard, you can specify the functionality after the fact by setting the **DBPROP_IRowsetChange** and **DBPROP_UPDATABILITY** properties on the command object. Then, when the rowset is created, it has the `IRowsetChange` interface.  \n  \n **Do you have older code using another data access technology (ADO, ODBC, or DAO)?**  \n Given the possible combinations of technologies (such as using ADO components with OLE DB components and migrating ODBC code to OLE DB), covering all situations is beyond the scope of the Visual C++ documentation. However, many articles covering various scenarios are available on the following Microsoft Web sites:  \n  \n-   [Microsoft Help and Support](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=148218)  \n  \n-   [Microsoft Data Access Technical Articles Overview](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=148217)  \n  \n-   [Visual Studio Solution Center](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=148215)  \n  \n-   [Search Microsoft.com](http://search.microsoft.com/)  \n  \n When you perform a search, enter a combination of keywords that best fits your scenario; for example: if you were using ADO objects with an OLE DB provider, try a Boolean search with **ADO AND \"OLE DB\"**. If you wanted to migrate older DAO code to ODBC, select \"all words\" and specify strings such as **migrating DAO**.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [OLE DB Programming](../../data/oledb/ole-db-programming.md)   \n [OLE DB Programming Overview](../../data/oledb/ole-db-programming-overview.md)"}
