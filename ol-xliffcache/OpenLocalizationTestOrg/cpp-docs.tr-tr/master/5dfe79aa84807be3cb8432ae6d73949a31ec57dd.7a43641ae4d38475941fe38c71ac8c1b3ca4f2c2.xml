The compiler cannot simply truncate the longer names to 8.3, because the first eight characters of the longer header filenames may not be unique. Whenever the compiler encounters the *long_filename* string, it substitutes *short_filename*, and looks for the header file *short_filename* instead. This pragma must appear before the corresponding `#include` directives. For example:  \n  \n```  \n// First eight characters of these two files not unique.  \n#pragma include_alias( \"AppleSystemHeaderQuickdraw.h\", \"quickdra.h\" )  \n#pragma include_alias( \"AppleSystemHeaderFruit.h\", \"fruit.h\" )  \n  \n#pragma include_alias( \"GraphicsMenu.h\", \"gramenu.h\" )  \n  \n#include \"AppleSystemHeaderQuickdraw.h\"  \n#include \"AppleSystemHeaderFruit.h\"  \n#include \"GraphicsMenu.h\"  \n```  \n  \n The alias being searched for must match the specification exactly, in case as well as in spelling and in use of double quotation marks or angle brackets. The **include_alias** pragma performs simple string matching on the filenames; no other filename validation is performed. For example, given the following directives,  \n  \n```  \n#pragma include_alias(\"mymath.h\", \"math.h\")  \n#include \"./mymath.h\"  \n#include \"sys/mymath.h\"  \n```  \n  \n no aliasing (substitution) is performed, since the header file strings do not match exactly. Also, header filenames used as arguments to the /Yu and /Yc compiler options, or the **hdrstop** pragma, are not substituted. For example, if your source file contains the following directive,  \n  \n```  \n#include <AppleSystemHeaderStop.h>  \n```  \n  \n the corresponding compiler option should be  \n  \n```  \n/YcAppleSystemHeaderStop.h  \n```  \n  \n You can use the **include_alias** pragma to map any header filename to another. For example:  \n  \n```  \n#pragma include_alias( \"api.h\", \"c:\\version1.0\\api.h\" )  \n#pragma include_alias( <stdio.h>, <newstdio.h> )  \n#include \"api.h\"  \n#include <stdio.h>  \n```  \n  \n Do not mix filenames enclosed in double quotation marks with filenames enclosed in angle brackets. For example, given the above two **#pragma include_alias** directives, the compiler performs no substitution on the following `#include` directives:  \n  \n```  \n#include <api.h>  \n#include \"stdio.h\"  \n```  \n  \n Furthermore, the following directive generates an error:  \n  \n```  \n#pragma include_alias(<header.h>, \"header.h\")  // Error  \n```  \n  \n Note that the filename reported in error messages, or as the value of the predefined **__FILE\\_\\_** macro, is the name of the file after the substitution has been performed. For example, after the following directives,  \n  \n```  \n#pragma include_alias( \"VeryLongFileName.H\", \"myfile.h\" )  \n#include \"VeryLongFileName.H\"  \n```  \n  \n an error in VERYLONGFILENAME.H produces the following error message:  \n  \n```  \nmyfile.h(15) : error C2059 : syntax error  \n```  \n  \n Also note that transitivity is not supported. Given the following directives,  \n  \n```  \n#pragma include_alias( \"one.h\", \"two.h\" )  \n#pragma include_alias( \"two.h\", \"three.h\" )  \n#include \"one.h\"  \n```  \n  \n the compiler searches for the file TWO.H rather than THREE.H.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Pragma Directives and the __Pragma Keyword](../preprocessor/pragma-directives-and-the-pragma-keyword.md)"}
