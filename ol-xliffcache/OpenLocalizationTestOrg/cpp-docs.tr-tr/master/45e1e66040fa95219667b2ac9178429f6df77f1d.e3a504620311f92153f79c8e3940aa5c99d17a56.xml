The syntax of the **critical** directive is as follows:  \n  \n```  \n#pragma omp critical [(name)]  new-linestructured-block  \n```  \n  \n An optional *name* may be used to identify the critical region. Identifiers used to identify a critical region have external linkage and are in a name space which is separate from the name spaces used by labels, tags, members, and ordinary identifiers.  \n  \n A thread waits at the beginning of a critical region until no other thread is executing a critical region (anywhere in the program) with the same name. All unnamed **critical** directives map to the same unspecified name."}
