These controls are laid out based on a dialog-template resource. Use `CFormView` if you want forms in your application. These views support scrolling, as needed, using the [CScrollView](../../mfc/reference/cscrollview-class.md) functionality.  \n  \n When you are [Creating a Forms-Based Application](../../mfc/reference/creating-a-forms-based-mfc-application.md), you can base its view class on `CFormView`, making it a forms-based application.  \n  \n You can also insert new [Form Topics](../../mfc/form-views-mfc.md) into document-view-based applications. Even if your application did not initially support forms, Visual C++ will add this support when you insert a new form.  \n  \n The MFC Application Wizard and the Add Class command are the preferred methods for creating forms-based applications. If you need to create a forms-based application without using these methods, see [Creating a Forms-Based Application](../../mfc/reference/creating-a-forms-based-mfc-application.md).  \n  \n## Inheritance Hierarchy  \n [CObject](../../mfc/reference/cobject-class.md)  \n  \n [CCmdTarget](../../mfc/reference/ccmdtarget-class.md)  \n  \n [CWnd](../../mfc/reference/cwnd-class.md)  \n  \n [CView](../../mfc/reference/cview-class.md)  \n  \n [CScrollView](../../mfc/reference/cscrollview-class.md)  \n  \n `CFormView`  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Header:** afxext.h  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cformview__cformview\"></a>  CFormView::CFormView  \n Constructs a `CFormView` object.  \n  \n```  \nCFormView(LPCTSTR lpszTemplateName);\n\n \nCFormView(UINT nIDTemplate);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `lpszTemplateName`  \n Contains a null-terminated string that is the name of a dialog-template resource.  \n  \n `nIDTemplate`  \n Contains the ID number of a dialog-template resource.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n When you create an object of a type derived from `CFormView`, invoke one of the constructors to create the view object and identify the dialog resource on which the view is based. You can identify the resource either by name (pass a string as the argument to the constructor) or by its ID (pass an unsigned integer as the argument).  \n  \n The form-view window and child controls are not created until `CWnd::Create` is called. `CWnd::Create` is called by the framework as part of the document and view creation process, which is driven by the document template.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  Your derived class *must* supply its own constructor. In the constructor, invoke the constructor, `CFormView::CFormView`, with the resource name or ID as an argument as shown in the preceding class overview.  \n  \n### Example  \n [!code-cpp[NVC_MFCDocView#90](../../mfc/codesnippet/cpp/cformview-class_1.h)]  \n  \n [!code-cpp[NVC_MFCDocView#91](../../mfc/codesnippet/cpp/cformview-class_2.cpp)]  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cformview__isinitdlgcompleted\"></a>  CFormView::IsInitDlgCompleted  \n Used by MFC to ensure that initialization is completed before performing other operations.  \n  \n```  \nBOOL IsInitDlgCompleted() const;\n\n \n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n True if the initialization function for this dialog has completed.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [MFC Sample SNAPVW](../../visual-cpp-samples.md)   \n [MFC Sample VIEWEX](../../visual-cpp-samples.md)   \n [CScrollView Class](../../mfc/reference/cscrollview-class.md)   \n [Hierarchy Chart](../../mfc/hierarchy-chart.md)   \n [CDialog Class](../../mfc/reference/cdialog-class.md)   \n [CScrollView Class](../../mfc/reference/cscrollview-class.md)\n"}
