Carriage return – linefeed (CR-LF) combinations are translated into a single linefeed (LF) on input. Linefeed characters are translated into CR-LF combinations on output. Also, CTRL+Z is interpreted as an end-of-file character on input. In files opened for reading and reading/writing, `fopen` checks for CTRL+Z at the end of the file and removes it, if possible. This is done because using the `fseek` and `ftell` functions to move within a file ending with CTRL+Z may cause `fseek` to behave improperly near the end of the file.  \n  \n `_O_BINARY`  \n Opens file in binary (untranslated) mode. The above translations are suppressed.  \n  \n `_O_RAW`  \n Same as `_O_BINARY`. Supported for C 2.0 compatibility.  \n  \n For more information, see [Text and Binary Mode File I/O](../c-runtime-library/text-and-binary-mode-file-i-o.md) and [File Translation](../c-runtime-library/file-translation-constants.md).  \n  \n## See Also  \n [_open, _wopen](../c-runtime-library/reference/open-wopen.md)   \n [_pipe](../c-runtime-library/reference/pipe.md)   \n [_sopen, _wsopen](../c-runtime-library/reference/sopen-wsopen.md)   \n [_setmode](../c-runtime-library/reference/setmode.md)   \n [Global Constants](../c-runtime-library/global-constants.md)"}
