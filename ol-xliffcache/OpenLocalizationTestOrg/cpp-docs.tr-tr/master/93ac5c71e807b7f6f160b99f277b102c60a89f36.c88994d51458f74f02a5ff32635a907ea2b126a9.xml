However, if the absolute path of the binary does not exist, as may be the case when you run profile scenarios on a different machine from where the binary was built, you can set `VCPROFILE_PATH` to a path that exists.  \n  \n## Example  \n  \n```  \nset VCPROFILE_PATH=c:\\  \n```  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Environment Variables for Profile-Guided Optimizations](../../build/reference/environment-variables-for-profile-guided-optimizations.md)"}
