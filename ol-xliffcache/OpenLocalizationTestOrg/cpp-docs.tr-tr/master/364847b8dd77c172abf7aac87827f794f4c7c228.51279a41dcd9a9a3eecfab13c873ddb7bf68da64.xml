This object represents the menu item or toolbar button or other user-interface object that generated the command. The update handler calls member functions of the `CCmdUI` structure through the pointer to update the user-interface object. For example, here is an update handler for the Clear All menu item:  \n  \n [!code-cpp[NVC_MFCDocView#3](../mfc/codesnippet/cpp/the-ccmdui-class_1.cpp)]  \n  \n This handler calls the **Enable** member function of an object with access to the menu item. **Enable** makes the item available for use.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [How to: Update User-Interface Objects](../mfc/how-to-update-user-interface-objects.md)\n\n"}
