You can create console apps to do basic work or to perform very sophisticated tasks. You can also use a console app as a proof-of-concept demonstration of functionality that you later want to incorporate into a Windows desktop application or Universal Windows Platform App. Console apps can communicate with other desktop apps by means of pipes or other RPC mechanisms.  \n  \n## Related Articles  \n  \n|Title|Description|  \n|-----------|-----------------|  \n|[Walkthrough: Creating a Standard C++ Program (C++)](../windows/walkthrough-creating-a-standard-cpp-program-cpp.md)|Describes how to create a console application that users can run from the command line.|  \n|[Creating a Console Application](../windows/creating-a-console-application.md)|Provides information about console applications.|"}
