A rule applies if:  \n  \n-   *toext* matches the target's extension.  \n  \n-   *fromext* matches the extension of a file that has the target's base name and that exists in the current or specified directory.  \n  \n-   *fromext* is in [.SUFFIXES](../build/dot-directives.md); no other *fromext* in a matching rule has a higher **.SUFFIXES** priority.  \n  \n-   No explicit dependent has a higher **.SUFFIXES** priority.  \n  \n Inferred dependents can cause unexpected side effects. If the target's description block contains commands, NMAKE executes those commands instead of the commands in the rule.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Inference Rules](../build/inference-rules.md)"}
