The format is as follows:  \n  \n```  \n#include <omp.h>  \nvoid omp_set_num_threads(int num_threads);  \n```  \n  \n The value of the parameter *num_threads* must be a positive integer. Its effect depends upon whether dynamic adjustment of the number of threads is enabled. For a comprehensive set of rules about the interaction between the `omp_set_num_threads` function and dynamic adjustment of threads, see Section 2.3 on page 8.  \n  \n This function has the effects described above when called from a portion of the program where the `omp_in_parallel` function returns zero. If it is called from a portion of the program where the `omp_in_parallel` function returns a nonzero value, the behavior of this function is undefined.  \n  \n This call has precedence over the `OMP_NUM_THREADS` environment variable. The default value for the number of threads, which may be established by calling `omp_set_num_threads` or by setting the `OMP_NUM_THREADS` environment variable, can be explicitly overridden on a single **parallel** directive by specifying the `num_threads` clause.  \n  \n## Cross References:  \n  \n-   `omp_set_dynamic` function, see [Section 3.1.7](../../parallel/openmp/3-1-7-omp-set-dynamic-function.md) on page 39.  \n  \n-   `omp_get_dynamic` function, see [Section 3.1.8](../../parallel/openmp/3-1-8-omp-get-dynamic-function.md) on page 40.  \n  \n-   `OMP_NUM_THREADS` environment variable, see [Section 4.2](../../parallel/openmp/4-2-omp-num-threads.md) on page 48, and Section 2.3 on page 8.  \n  \n-   `num_threads` clause, see [Section 2.3](../../parallel/openmp/2-3-parallel-construct.md) on page 8"}
