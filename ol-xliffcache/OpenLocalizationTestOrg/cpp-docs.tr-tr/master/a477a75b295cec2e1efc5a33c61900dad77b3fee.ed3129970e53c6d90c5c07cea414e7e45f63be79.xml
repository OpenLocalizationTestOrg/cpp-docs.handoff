For information about OLE DB record views, see [COleDBRecordView](../mfc/reference/coledbrecordview-class.md) and [Using OLE DB Record Views](../data/oledb/using-ole-db-record-views.md).  \n  \n To support form-based data-access applications, the class library provides class [CRecordView](../mfc/reference/crecordview-class.md) and class [CDaoRecordView](../mfc/reference/cdaorecordview-class.md). A record view is a form view object whose controls are mapped directly to the field data members of a [recordset](../data/odbc/recordset-odbc.md) object (and indirectly to the corresponding columns in a query result or table on the data source). Like their base class [CFormView](../mfc/reference/cformview-class.md), `CRecordView` and `CDaoRecordView` are based on a dialog template resource.  \n  \n## Form Uses  \n Forms are useful for a variety of data-access tasks:  \n  \n-   Entering data  \n  \n-   Performing read-only examination of data  \n  \n-   Updating data  \n  \n## Further Reading About Record Views  \n The material in topics applies to both the ODBC-based and the DAO-based classes. Use `CRecordView` for ODBC and `CDaoRecordView` for DAO.  \n  \n Topics include:  \n  \n-   [Features of Record View Classes](../data/features-of-record-view-classes-mfc-data-access.md)  \n  \n-   [Data Exchange for Record Views](../data/data-exchange-for-record-views-mfc-data-access.md)  \n  \n-   [Your Role in Working with a Record View](../data/your-role-in-working-with-a-record-view-mfc-data-access.md)  \n  \n-   [Designing and Creating a Record View](../data/designing-and-creating-a-record-view-mfc-data-access.md)  \n  \n-   [Using a Record View](../data/using-a-record-view-mfc-data-access.md)  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Data Access Programming (MFC/ATL)](../data/data-access-programming-mfc-atl.md)   \n [ODBC Driver List](../data/odbc/odbc-driver-list.md)"}
