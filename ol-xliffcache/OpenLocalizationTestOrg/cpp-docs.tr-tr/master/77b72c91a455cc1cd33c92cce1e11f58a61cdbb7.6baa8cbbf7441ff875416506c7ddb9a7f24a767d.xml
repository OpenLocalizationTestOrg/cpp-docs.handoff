Automation servers (applications that can be controlled by other applications) are supported through [dispatch maps](../mfc/reference/dispatch-maps.md).  \n  \n [COleDispatchDriver](../mfc/reference/coledispatchdriver-class.md)  \n Used to call automation servers from your automation client. When adding a class, this class is used to create type-safe classes for automation servers that provide a type library.  \n  \n [COleDispatchException](../mfc/reference/coledispatchexception-class.md)  \n An exception resulting from an error during OLE automation.
