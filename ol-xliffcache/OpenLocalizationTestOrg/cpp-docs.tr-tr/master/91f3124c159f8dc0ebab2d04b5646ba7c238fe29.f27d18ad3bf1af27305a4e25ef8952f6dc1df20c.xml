The backslash is ignored and not printed. The character following the backslash is printed.  \n  \n To print a single backslash, specify a double backslash (\\\\\\\\).  \n  \n The C++ standard, in section 2.13.2 discusses escape sequences.  \n  \n The following sample generates C4129:  \n  \n```  \n// C4129.cpp  \n// compile with: /W1  \nint main() {  \n   char array1[] = \"\\/709\";   // C4129  \n   char array2[] = \"\\n709\";   // OK  \n}  \n```"}
