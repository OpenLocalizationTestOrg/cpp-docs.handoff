Directories are searched only until the specified include file is found.  \n  \n You can use this option with the Ignore Standard Include Paths ([/X (Ignore Standard Include Paths)](../../build/reference/x-ignore-standard-include-paths.md)) option.  \n  \n The compiler searches for directories in the following order:  \n  \n1.  Directories containing the source file.  \n  \n2.  Directories specified with the **/I** option, in the order that CL encounters them.  \n  \n3.  Directories specified in the **INCLUDE** environment variable.  \n  \n### To set this compiler option in the Visual Studio development environment  \n  \n1.  Open the project's **Property Pages** dialog box. For details, see [Working with Project Properties](../../ide/working-with-project-properties.md).  \n  \n2.  Click the **C/C++** folder.  \n  \n3.  Click the **General** property page.  \n  \n4.  Modify the **Additional Include Directories** property.  \n  \n### To set this compiler option programmatically  \n  \n-   See <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.VCProjectEngine.VCCLCompilerTool.AdditionalIncludeDirectories%2A>.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following command looks for the include files requested by MAIN.c in the following order: first in the directory containing MAIN.c, then in the \\INCLUDE directory, then in the \\MY\\INCLUDE directory, and finally in the directories assigned to the INCLUDE environment variable.  \n  \n```  \nCL /I \\INCLUDE /I\\MY\\INCLUDE MAIN.C  \n```  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Compiler Options](../../build/reference/compiler-options.md)   \n [Setting Compiler Options](../../build/reference/setting-compiler-options.md)"}
