To extract a copy of a member, use the following syntax:  \n  \n```  \nLIB library /EXTRACT:member /OUT:objectfile  \n```  \n  \n This command creates an .obj file called *objectfile* that contains a copy of a `member` of a *library*. The `member` name is case sensitive. You can extract only one member in a single command. The /OUT option is required; there is no default output name. If a file called *objectfile* already exists in the specified directory (or the current directory, if no directory is specified with *objectfile*), the extracted *objectfile* replaces the existing file.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [LIB Reference](../../build/reference/lib-reference.md)"}
