For the Microsoft C compiler, an integer is the same as a **long**.  \n  \n **Microsoft Specific**  \n  \n No conversions between structure or union types are allowed.  \n  \n Any value can be converted to type `void`, but the result of such a conversion can be used only in a context where an expression value is discarded, such as in an expression statement.  \n  \n The `void` type has no value, by definition. Therefore, it cannot be converted to any other type, and other types cannot be converted to `void` by assignment. However, you can explicitly cast a value to type `void`, as discussed in [Type-Cast Conversions](../c-language/type-cast-conversions.md).  \n  \n **END Microsoft Specific**  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Assignment Conversions](../c-language/assignment-conversions.md)"}
