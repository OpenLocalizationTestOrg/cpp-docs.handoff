The preprocessor performs preliminary operations on C and C++ files before they are passed to the compiler. You can use the preprocessor to conditionally compile code, insert files, specify compile-time error messages, and apply machine-specific rules to sections of code.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Preprocessor Directives](../preprocessor/preprocessor-directives.md)  \n Describes directives, typically used to make source programs easy to change and easy to compile in different execution environments.  \n  \n [Preprocessor Operators](../preprocessor/preprocessor-operators.md)  \n Discusses the four preprocessor-specific operators used in the context of the `#define` directive.  \n  \n [Predefined Macros](../preprocessor/predefined-macros.md)  \n Discusses predefined macros as specified by ANSI and Microsoft C++.  \n  \n [Pragmas](../preprocessor/pragma-directives-and-the-pragma-keyword.md)  \n Discusses pragmas, which offer a way for each compiler to offer machine- and operating system-specific features while retaining overall compatibility with the C and C++ languages.  \n  \n## Related Sections  \n [C++ Language Reference](../cpp/cpp-language-reference.md)  \n Provides reference material for the Microsoft implementation of the C++ language.  \n  \n [C Language Reference](../c-language/c-language-reference.md)  \n Provides reference material for the Microsoft implementation of the C language.  \n  \n [Building a C/C++ Program](../build/reference/c-cpp-building-reference.md)  \n Provides links to topics discussing compiler and linker options.  \n  \n [Visual C++ Libraries](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/fec23c40-10c0-4857-9cdc-33a3b99b30ae)  \n Provides links to the various libraries provided with Visual C++, including ATL, MFC, OLE DB, the C run-time library, and the Standard C++ Library.  \n  \n [Creating and Managing Visual C++ Projects](../ide/creating-and-managing-visual-cpp-projects.md)  \n Describes the user interface in Visual Studio that enables you to specify the directories that the project system will search to locate files for your C++ project."}
