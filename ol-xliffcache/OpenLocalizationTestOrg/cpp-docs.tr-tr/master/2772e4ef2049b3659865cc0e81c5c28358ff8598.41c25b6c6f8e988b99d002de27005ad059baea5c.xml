Open the string tables in both .rc files. (For more information, see [Viewing Resources in a Resource Script File Outside of a Project](../windows/how-to-open-a-resource-script-file-outside-of-a-project-standalone.md).)  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  If your project doesn't already contain an .rc file, please see [Creating a New Resource Script File](../windows/how-to-create-a-resource-script-file.md).  \n  \n2.  Right-click the string you want to move and choose **Cut** from the shortcut menu.  \n  \n3.  Place the cursor in the target **String Editor** window.  \n  \n4.  In the .rc file to which you want to move the string, right-click and choose **Paste** from the shortcut menu.  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  If the **ID** or **value** of the moved string conflicts with an existing **ID** or **value** in the destination file, either the **ID** or the **value** of the moved string changes. If a string exists with the same **ID**, the **ID** of the moved string changes. If a string exists with the same **value**, the **value** of the moved string changes.  \n  \n For information on adding resources to managed projects (those that target the common language runtime), please see [Resources in Applications](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/8ad495d4-2941-40cf-bf64-e82e85825890) in the *.NET Framework Developer's Guide.* For information on manually adding resource files to managed projects, accessing resources, displaying static resources, and assigning resources strings to properties, see [Walkthrough: Localizing Windows Forms](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/9a96220d-a19b-4de0-9f48-01e5d82679e5) and [Walkthrough: Using Resources for Localization with ASP.NET](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/bb4e5b44-e2b0-48ab-bbe9-609fb33900b6).  \n  \n **Requirements**  \n  \n Win32  \n  \n## See Also  \n [String Editor](../mfc/string-editor.md)   \n [Resource Files](../mfc/resource-files-visual-studio.md)   \n [Customizing window layouts](/visualstudio/ide/customizing-window-layouts-in-visual-studio)   \n\n"}
