character string in the current locale to its wide character string representation. A version of [mbsrtowcs](../../c-runtime-library/reference/mbsrtowcs.md) with security enhancements as described in [Security Features in the CRT](../../c-runtime-library/security-features-in-the-crt.md).  \n  \n## Syntax  \n  \n```  \nerrno_t mbsrtowcs_s(  \n   size_t * pReturnValue,  \n   wchar_t * wcstr,  \n   size_t sizeInWords,  \n   const char ** mbstr,  \n   size_t count,  \n   mbstate_t * mbstate  \n);  \ntemplate <size_t size>  \nerrno_t mbsrtowcs_s(  \n   size_t * pReturnValue,  \n   wchar_t (&wcstr)[size],  \n   const char ** mbstr,  \n   size_t count,  \n   mbstate_t * mbstate  \n); // C++ only  \n```  \n  \n#### Parameters  \n [out] `pReturnValue`  \n The number of characters converted.  \n  \n [out] `wcstr`  \n Address of buffer to store the resulting converted wide character string.  \n  \n [out] `sizeInWords`  \n The size of `wcstr` in words (wide characters).  \n  \n [in, out] `mbstr`  \n Indirect pointer to the location of the multibyte character string to be converted.  \n  \n [in] `count`  \n The maximum number of wide characters to store in the `wcstr` buffer, not including the terminating null, or [_TRUNCATE](../../c-runtime-library/truncate.md).  \n  \n [in, out] `mbstate`  \n A pointer to an `mbstate_t` conversion state object. If this value is a null pointer, a static internal conversion state object is used. Because the internal `mbstate_t` object is not thread-safe, we recommend that you always pass your own `mbstate` parameter.  \n  \n## Return Value  \n Zero if conversion is successful, or an error code on failure.  \n  \n|Error condition|Return value and `errno`|  \n|---------------------|------------------------------|  \n|`wcstr` is a null pointer and `sizeInWords` > 0|`EINVAL`|  \n|`mbstr` is a null pointer|`EINVAL`|  \n|The string indirectly pointed to by `mbstr` contains a multibyte sequence that is not valid for the current locale.|`EILSEQ`|  \n|The destination buffer is too small to contain the converted string (unless `count` is `_TRUNCATE`; for more information, see Remarks)|`ERANGE`|  \n  \n If any one of these conditions occurs, the invalid parameter exception is invoked as described in [Parameter Validation](../../c-runtime-library/parameter-validation.md) . If execution is allowed to continue, the function returns an error code and sets `errno` as indicated in the table.  \n  \n## Remarks  \n The `mbsrtowcs_s` function converts a string of multibyte characters indirectly pointed to by `mbstr` into wide characters stored in the buffer pointed to by `wcstr`, by using the conversion state contained in `mbstate`. The conversion will continue for each character until one of these conditions is met:  \n  \n-   A multibyte null character is encountered  \n  \n-   An invalid multibyte character is encountered  \n  \n-   The number of wide characters stored in the `wcstr` buffer equals `count`.  \n  \n The destination string `wcstr` is always null-terminated, even in the case of an error, unless `wcstr` is a null pointer.  \n  \n If `count` is the special value [_TRUNCATE](../../c-runtime-library/truncate.md), `mbsrtowcs_s` converts as much of the string as will fit into the destination buffer, while still leaving room for a null terminator.  \n  \n If `mbsrtowcs_s` successfully converts the source string, it puts the size in wide characters of the converted string and the null terminator into `*``pReturnValue`, provided `pReturnValue` is not a null pointer. This occurs even if the `wcstr` argument is a null pointer and lets you determine the required buffer size. Note that if `wcstr` is a null pointer, `count` is ignored.  \n  \n If `wcstr` is not a null pointer, the pointer object pointed to by `mbstr` is assigned a null pointer if conversion stopped because a terminating null character was reached. Otherwise, it is assigned the address just past the last multibyte character converted, if any. This allows a subsequent function call to restart conversion where this call stopped.  \n  \n If `mbstate` is a null pointer, the library internal `mbstate_t` conversion state static object is used. Because this internal static object is not thread-safe, we recommend that you pass your own `mbstate` value.  \n  \n If `mbsrtowcs_s` encounters a multibyte character that is not valid in the current locale, it puts -1 in `*``pReturnValue`, sets the destination buffer `wcstr` to an empty string, sets `errno` to `EILSEQ`, and returns `EILSEQ`.  \n  \n If the sequences pointed to by `mbstr` and `wcstr` overlap, the behavior of `mbsrtowcs_s` is undefined. `mbsrtowcs_s` is affected by the LC_TYPE category of the current locale.  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  Ensure that `wcstr` and `mbstr` do not overlap, and that `count` correctly reflects the number of multibyte characters to convert.  \n  \n The `mbsrtowcs_s` function differs from [mbstowcs_s, _mbstowcs_s_l](../../c-runtime-library/reference/mbstowcs-s-mbstowcs-s-l.md) by its restartability. The conversion state is stored in `mbstate` for subsequent calls to the same or other restartable functions. Results are undefined when mixing the use of restartable and nonrestartable functions. For example, an application should use `mbsrlen` instead of `mbslen`, if a subsequent call to `mbsrtowcs_s` is used instead of `mbstowcs_s.`  \n  \n In C++, using this function is simplified by template overloads; the overloads can infer buffer length automatically (eliminating the requirement to specify a size argument) and they can automatically replace older, non-secure functions by using their newer, secure counterparts. For more information, see [Secure Template Overloads](../../c-runtime-library/secure-template-overloads.md).  \n  \n## Exceptions  \n The `mbsrtowcs_s` function is multithread safe if no function in the current thread calls `setlocale` as long as this function is executing and the `mbstate` argument is not a null pointer.  \n  \n## .NET Framework Equivalent  \n Not applicable. To call the standard C function, use `PInvoke`.
