is based on the Microsoft Foundation Class (MFC) Library. The easiest way to create an MFC application is to use the MFC Application Wizard.  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  MFC projects are not supported in Visual Studio Express editions.  \n  \n MFC executables generally fall into five types: standard Windows applications, dialog boxes, forms-based applications, Explorer-style applications, and Web browser–style applications. For more information, see:  \n  \n-   [Using the Classes to Write Windows Applications](../../mfc/using-the-classes-to-write-applications-for-windows.md)  \n  \n-   [Creating and Displaying Dialog Boxes](../../mfc/creating-and-displaying-dialog-boxes.md)  \n  \n-   [Creating a Forms-Based MFC Application](../../mfc/reference/creating-a-forms-based-mfc-application.md)  \n  \n-   [Creating a File Explorer-Style MFC Application](../../mfc/reference/creating-a-file-explorer-style-mfc-application.md)  \n  \n-   [Creating a Web Browser-Style MFC Application](../../mfc/reference/creating-a-web-browser-style-mfc-application.md)  \n  \n The MFC Application Wizard generates the appropriate classes and files for any of these types of applications, depending on the options you select in the wizard.  \n  \n### To create an MFC application using the MFC Application Wizard  \n  \n1.  Follow the instructions in the help topic [Creating a Project with a Visual C++ Application Wizard](../../ide/creating-desktop-projects-by-using-application-wizards.md).  \n  \n2.  In the **New Project** dialog box, select **MFC Application** in the Templates pane to open the wizard.  \n  \n3.  Define your application settings using the [MFC Application Wizard](../../mfc/reference/mfc-application-wizard.md).  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  Skip this step to keep the wizard default settings.  \n  \n4.  Click **Finish** to close the wizard and open your new project in the development environment.  \n  \n Once your project is created, you can view the files created in **Solution Explorer**. For more information about the files the wizard creates for your project, see the project-generated file ReadMe.txt. For more information about the file types, see [File Types Created for Visual C++ Projects](../../ide/file-types-created-for-visual-cpp-projects.md).  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Debugging Preparation: Visual C++ Windows Applications](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/a8bc54de-41a3-464d-9a12-db9bdcbc1ad5)   \n [Adding Functionality with Code Wizards](../../ide/adding-functionality-with-code-wizards-cpp.md)   \n [Property Pages](../../ide/property-pages-visual-cpp.md)   \n [Deploying Applications](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/4ff8881d-0daf-47e7-bfe7-774c625031b4)\n\n"}
