# Container Class::iterator
> [!NOTE]
>  This topic is in the Visual C++ documentation as a nonfunctional example of containers used in the Standard C++ Library. For more information, see [STL Containers](../standard-library/stl-containers.md).  
  
 Describes an object that can serve as an iterator for the controlled sequence.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
 
typedef T5 iterator;  
```  
  
## Remarks  
 It is described here as a synonym for the unspecified type **T5**. An object of type **iterator** can be cast to an object of type [const_iterator](../standard-library/container-class-const-iterator.md).
