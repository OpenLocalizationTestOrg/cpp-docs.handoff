Class\nDescribes a [max class](../standard-library/allocators-header.md) object that does not limit the maximum length of a [freelist](../standard-library/freelist-class.md) object.  \n  \n## Syntax  \n  \n```\nclass max_unbounded\n```  \n  \n### Member Functions  \n  \n|||  \n|-|-|  \n|[allocated](#max_unbounded__allocated)|Increments the count of allocated memory blocks.|  \n|[deallocated](#max_unbounded__deallocated)|Decrements the count of allocated memory blocks.|  \n|[full](#max_unbounded__full)|Returns a value that specifies whether more memory blocks should be added to the free list.|  \n|[released](#max_unbounded__released)|Decrements the count of memory blocks on the free list.|  \n|[saved](#max_unbounded__saved)|Increments the count of memory blocks on the free list.|  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Header:** \\<allocators>  \n  \n **Namespace:** stdext  \n  \n##  <a name=\"max_unbounded__allocated\"></a>  max_unbounded::allocated  \n Increments the count of allocated memory blocks.  \n  \n```\nvoid allocated(std::size_t _Nx = 1);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n  \n|Parameter|Description|  \n|---------------|-----------------|  \n|`_Nx`|The increment value.|  \n  \n### Remarks  \n This member function does nothing. It is called after each successful call by `cache_freelist::allocate` to operator `new`. The argument `_Nx` is the number of memory blocks in the chunk allocated by operator `new`.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"max_unbounded__deallocated\"></a>  max_unbounded::deallocated  \n Decrements the count of allocated memory blocks.  \n  \n```\nvoid deallocated(std::size_t _Nx = 1);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n  \n|Parameter|Description|  \n|---------------|-----------------|  \n|`_Nx`|The increment value.|  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The member function does nothing. This member function is called after each call by `cache_freelist::deallocate` to operator `delete`. The argument `_Nx` is the number of memory blocks in the chunk deallocated by operator `delete`.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"max_unbounded__full\"></a>  max_unbounded::full  \n Returns a value that specifies whether more memory blocks should be added to the free list.  \n  \n```\nbool full();\n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n The member function always returns `false`.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n This member function is called by `cache_freelist::deallocate`. If the call returns `true`, `deallocate` puts the memory block on the free list; if it returns false, `deallocate` calls operator `delete` to deallocate the block.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"max_unbounded__released\"></a>  max_unbounded::released  \n Decrements the count of memory blocks on the free list.  \n  \n```\nvoid released();\n```  \n  \n### Remarks  \n This member function does nothing. The `released` member function of the current max class is called by `cache_freelist::allocate` whenever it removes a memory block from the free list.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"max_unbounded__saved\"></a>  max_unbounded::saved  \n Increments the count of memory blocks on the free list.  \n  \n```\nvoid saved();\n```  \n  \n### Remarks  \n This member function does nothing. It is called by `cache_freelist::deallocate` whenever it puts a memory block on the free list.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [\\<allocators>](../standard-library/allocators-header.md)\n\n\n\n"}
