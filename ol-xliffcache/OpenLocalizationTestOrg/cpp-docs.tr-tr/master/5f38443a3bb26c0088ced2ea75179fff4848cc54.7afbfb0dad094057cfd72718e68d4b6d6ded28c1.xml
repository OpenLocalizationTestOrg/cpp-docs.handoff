However, `CComFakeCriticalSection` does not provide a critical section; therefore, its methods do nothing.  \n  \n Typically, you use `CComFakeCriticalSection` through a `typedef` name, either `AutoCriticalSection` or `CriticalSection`. When using [CComSingleThreadModel](../../atl/reference/ccomsinglethreadmodel-class.md) or [CComMultiThreadModelNoCS](../../atl/reference/ccommultithreadmodelnocs-class.md), both of these `typedef` names reference `CComFakeCriticalSection`. When using [CComMultiThreadModel](../../atl/reference/ccommultithreadmodel-class.md), they reference [CComAutoCriticalSection](../../atl/reference/ccomautocriticalsection-class.md) and `CComCriticalSection`, respectively.  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Header:** atlcore.h  \n  \n##  <a name=\"ccomfakecriticalsection__init\"></a>  CComFakeCriticalSection::Init  \n Does nothing since there is no critical section.  \n  \n```\nHRESULT Init() throw();\n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Returns S_OK.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"ccomfakecriticalsection__lock\"></a>  CComFakeCriticalSection::Lock  \n Does nothing since there is no critical section.  \n  \n```\nHRESULT Lock() throw();\n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Returns S_OK.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"ccomfakecriticalsection__term\"></a>  CComFakeCriticalSection::Term  \n Does nothing since there is no critical section.  \n  \n```\nHRESULT Term() throw();\n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Returns S_OK.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"ccomfakecriticalsection__unlock\"></a>  CComFakeCriticalSection::Unlock  \n Does nothing since there is no critical section.  \n  \n```\nHRESULT Unlock() throw();\n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Returns S_OK.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Class Overview](../../atl/atl-class-overview.md)\n"}
