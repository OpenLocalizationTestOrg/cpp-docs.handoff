wcsrtombs\nConvert a wide character string to its multibyte character string representation. A more secure version of this function is available; see [wcsrtombs_s](../../c-runtime-library/reference/wcsrtombs-s.md).  \n  \n## Syntax  \n  \n```  \nsize_t wcsrtombs(  \n   char *mbstr,  \n   const wchar_t **wcstr,  \n   sizeof count,  \n   mbstate_t *mbstate  \n);  \ntemplate <size_t size>  \nsize_t wcsrtombs(  \n   char (&mbstr)[size],  \n   const wchar_t **wcstr,  \n   sizeof count,  \n   mbstate_t *mbstate  \n); // C++ only  \n```  \n  \n#### Parameters  \n [out] `mbstr`  \n The resulting converted multibyte character string's address location.  \n  \n [in] `wcstr`  \n Indirectly points to the location of the wide character string to be converted.  \n  \n [in] `count`  \n The number of character to be converted.  \n  \n [in] `mbstate`  \n A pointer to an `mbstate_t` conversion state object.  \n  \n## Return Value  \n Returns the number of bytes successfully converted, not including the null terminating null byte (if any), otherwise a -1 if an error occurred.  \n  \n## Remarks  \n The `wcsrtombs` function converts a string of wide characters, beginning in the specified conversion state contained in `mbstate`, from the values indirect pointed to in `wcstr`, into the address of `mbstr`. The conversion will continue for each character until: after a null terminating wide character is encountered, when a non corresponding character is encountered or when the next character would exceed the limit contained in `count`. If `wcsrtombs` encounters the wide-character null character (L'\\0') either before or when `count` occurs, it converts it to an 8-bit 0 and stops.  \n  \n Thus, the multibyte character string at `mbstr` is null-terminated only if `wcsrtombs` encounters a wide character null character during conversion. If the sequences pointed to by `wcstr` and `mbstr` overlap, the behavior of `wcsrtombs` is undefined. `wcsrtombs` is affected by the LC_TYPE category of the current locale.  \n  \n The `wcsrtombs` function differs from [wcstombs, _wcstombs_l](../../c-runtime-library/reference/wcstombs-wcstombs-l.md) by its restartability. The conversion state is stored in `mbstate` for subsequent calls to the same or other restartable functions. Results are undefined when mixing the use of restartable and nonrestartable functions.  For example, an application would use `wcsrlen` rather than `wcsnlen`, if a subsequent call to `wcsrtombs` were used instead of `wcstombs`.  \n  \n If the `mbstr` argument is `NULL`, `wcsrtombs` returns the required size in bytes of the destination string. If `mbstate` is null, the internal `mbstate_t` conversion state is used. If the character sequence `wchar` does not have a corresponding multibyte character representation, a -1 is returned and the `errno` is set to `EILSEQ`.  \n  \n In C++, this function has a template overload that invokes the newer, secure counterpart of this function. For more information, see [Secure Template Overloads](../../c-runtime-library/secure-template-overloads.md).  \n  \n## Exceptions  \n The `wcsrtombs` function is multithread safe as long as no function in the current thread calls `setlocale` while this function is executing and the `mbstate` is not null.  \n  \n## Example  \n  \n```  \n// crt_wcsrtombs.cpp  \n// compile with: /W3  \n// This code example converts a wide  \n// character string into a multibyte  \n// character string.  \n  \n#include <stdio.h>  \n#include <memory.h>  \n#include <wchar.h>  \n#include <errno.h>  \n  \n#define MB_BUFFER_SIZE 100  \n  \nint main()  \n{  \n    const wchar_t   wcString[] =   \n                    {L\"Every good boy does fine.\"};  \n    const wchar_t   *wcsIndirectString = wcString;  \n    char            mbString[MB_BUFFER_SIZE];  \n    size_t          countConverted;  \n    mbstate_t       mbstate;  \n  \n    // Reset to initial shift state  \n    ::memset((void*)&mbstate, 0, sizeof(mbstate));  \n  \n    countConverted = wcsrtombs(mbString, &wcsIndirectString,  \n                               MB_BUFFER_SIZE, &mbstate); // C4996  \n    // Note: wcsrtombs is deprecated; consider using wcsrtombs_s  \n    if (errno == EILSEQ)  \n    {  \n        printf( \"An encoding error was detected in the string.\\n\" );  \n    }  \n    else   \n    {  \n        printf( \"The string was successfuly converted.\\n\" );  \n    }  \n}  \n```  \n  \n```Output  \nThe string was successfuly converted.  \n```  \n  \n## .NET Framework Equivalent  \n Not applicable.
