however, your resulting executable usually will be larger than that created by using `CStatusBarCtrl`.  \n  \n `CStatusBarCtrl` usually results in a smaller executable, and you may prefer to use `CStatusBarCtrl` if you do not intend to integrate the status bar into the MFC architecture. If you plan to use `CStatusBarCtrl` and integrate the status bar into the MFC architecture, you must take additional care to communicate status bar control manipulations to MFC. This communication is not difficult; however, it is additional work that is unneeded when you use `CStatusBar`.  \n  \n Visual C++ provides two ways to take advantage of the status bar common control.  \n  \n-   Create the status bar using `CStatusBar`, and then call [CStatusBar::GetStatusBarCtrl](../mfc/reference/cstatusbar-class.md#cstatusbar__getstatusbarctrl) to get access to the `CStatusBarCtrl` member functions.  \n  \n-   Create the status bar using [CStatusBarCtrl](../mfc/reference/cstatusbarctrl-class.md)'s constructor.  \n  \n Either method will give you access to the member functions of the status bar control. When you call `CStatusBar::GetStatusBarCtrl`, it returns a reference to a `CStatusBarCtrl` object so you can use either set of member functions. See [CStatusBar](../mfc/reference/cstatusbar-class.md) for information on constructing and creating a status bar using `CStatusBar`.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Using CStatusBarCtrl](../mfc/using-cstatusbarctrl.md)   \n [Controls](../mfc/controls-mfc.md)\n\n"}
