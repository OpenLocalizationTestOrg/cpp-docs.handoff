The instruction includes a short offset that represents the distance between the jump and the target address, the function definition. During linking a function may be moved or subject to link-time optimizations that cause the function to be moved out of the range reachable from a short offset. The compiler must generate a special record for the jump, which requires the jmp instruction to be either NEAR or FAR. The compiler made the conversion.  \n  \n For example, the following code generates C4414:  \n  \n```  \n// C4414.cpp  \n// compile with: /W3 /c  \n// processor: x86  \nint DoParityEven();  \nint DoParityOdd();  \nunsigned char global;  \nint __declspec(naked) DoParityEither()  \n{  \n   __asm  \n   {  \n      test global,0  \n      jpe SHORT DoParityEven  // C4414  \n      jmp SHORT DoParityOdd   // C4414  \n   }  \n}  \n```"}
