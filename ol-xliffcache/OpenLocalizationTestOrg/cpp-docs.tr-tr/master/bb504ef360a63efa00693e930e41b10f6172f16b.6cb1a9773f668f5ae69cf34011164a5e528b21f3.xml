In this section, we look at the CLR enum type and the value class type, together with a look at boxing and access to the boxed instance on the CLR heap, as well as a look at interior and pinning pointers. There have been extensive language changes in this area.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [CLR Enum Type](../dotnet/value-types-and-their-behaviors-cpp-cli.md)  \n Discusses changes in the declaration and behavior of enums.  \n  \n [Implicit Boxing of Value Types](../dotnet/implicit-boxing-of-value-types.md)  \n Discusses the motivation for implicit boxing of value types and the consequent changes in behavior.  \n  \n [A Tracking Handle to a Boxed Value](../dotnet/a-tracking-handle-to-a-boxed-value.md)  \n Discusses how implicit boxing of value types translates to a tracking handle to the boxed value object.  \n  \n [Value Type Semantics](../dotnet/value-type-semantics.md)  \n Discusses changes to value type semantics, including inherited virtual methods, class default constructors, interior pointers, and pinning pointers.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [C++/CLI Migration Primer](../dotnet/cpp-cli-migration-primer.md)   \n [Classes and Structs](../windows/classes-and-structs-cpp-component-extensions.md)"}
