&lt;iterator&gt;\nDefines the iterator primitives, predefined iterators and stream iterators, as well as several supporting templates. The predefined iterators include insert and reverse adaptors. There are three classes of insert iterator adaptors: front, back, and general. They provide insert semantics rather than the overwrite semantics that the container member function iterators provide.  \n  \n## Syntax  \n  \n```  \n#include <iterator>  \n  \n```  \n  \n## Remarks  \n Iterators are a generalization of pointers, abstracting from their requirements in a way that allows a C++ program to work with different data structures in a uniform manner. Iterators act as intermediaries between containers and generic algorithms. Instead of operating on specific data types, algorithms are defined to operate on a range specified by a type of iterator. Any data structure that satisfies the requirements of the iterator may then be operated on by the algorithm. There are five types or categories of iterator, each with its own set of requirements and resulting functionality:  \n  \n-   Output: forward moving, may store but not retrieve values, provided by ostream and inserter.  \n  \n-   Input: forward moving, may retrieve but not store values, provided by istream.  \n  \n-   Forward: forward moving, may store and retrieve values.  \n  \n-   Bidirectional: forward and backward moving, may store and retrieve values, provided by list, set, multiset, map, and multimap.  \n  \n-   Random access: elements accessed in any order, may store and retrieve values, provided by vector, deque, string, and array.  \n  \n Iterators that have greater requirements and so more powerful access to elements may be used in place of iterators with fewer requirements. For example, if a forward iterator is called for, then a random-access iterator may used instead.  \n  \n Visual Studio has added extensions to C++ Standard Library iterators to support a variety of debug mode situations for checked and unchecked iterators.

It inserts elements of class **Elem** into an output stream buffer, which it accesses through an object it stores, of type **pointer** to `basic_streambuf`\\<**Elem**, **Tr**>.|  \n|[iterator](../standard-library/iterator-struct.md)|The template class is used as a base type for all iterators.|  \n|[iterator_traits](../standard-library/iterator-traits-struct.md)|A template helper class providing critical types that are associated with different iterator types so that they can be referred to in the same way.|  \n|[move_iterator](../standard-library/move-iterator-class.md)|A `move_iterator` object stores a random-access iterator of type `RandomIterator`. It behaves like a random-access iterator, except when dereferenced. The result of `operator*` is implicitly cast to `value_type&&:` to make an `rvalue reference`.|  \n|[ostream_iterator](../standard-library/ostream-iterator-class.md)|The template class describes an output iterator object. It inserts objects of class **Type** into an output stream, which it accesses through an object it stores, of type **pointer** to `basic_ostream`\\<**Elem**, **Tr**>.|  \n|[ostreambuf_iterator Class](../standard-library/ostreambuf-iterator-class.md)|The template class describes an output iterator object. It inserts elements of class **Elem** into an output stream buffer, which it accesses through an object it stores, of type pointer to `basic_streambuf`\\<**Elem**, **Tr**>.|  \n|[output_iterator_tag](../standard-library/output-iterator-tag-struct.md)|A class that provides a return type for **iterator_category** function that represents an output iterator.|  \n|[random_access_iterator_tag](../standard-library/random-access-iterator-tag-struct.md)|A class that provides a return type for **iterator_category** function that represents a random-access iterator.|  \n|[reverse_iterator](../standard-library/reverse-iterator-class.md)|The template class describes an object that behaves like a random-access iterator, only in reverse.|  \n|[unchecked_array_iterator](../standard-library/unchecked-array-iterator-class.md)|A class that accesses an array using a random access, unchecked iterator. **Note:**  This class is a Microsoft extension of the Standard C++ Library. Code implemented by using this function is not portable to C++ Standard build environments that do not support this Microsoft extension.|  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Header Files Reference](../standard-library/cpp-standard-library-header-files.md)   \n [Thread Safety in the C++ Standard Library](../standard-library/thread-safety-in-the-cpp-standard-library.md)   \n [C++ Standard Library Reference](../standard-library/cpp-standard-library-reference.md)\n\n\n\n"}
