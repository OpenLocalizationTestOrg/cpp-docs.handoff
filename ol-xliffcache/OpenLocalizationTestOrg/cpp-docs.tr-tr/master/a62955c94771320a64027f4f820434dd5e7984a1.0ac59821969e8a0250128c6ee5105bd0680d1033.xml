Sets the value stored at the specified location to the bitwise `xor` of that value and a specified value as an atomic operation.|  \n|[copy Function](concurrency-namespace-functions-amp.md#copy)|Copies a C++ AMP object. All synchronous data transfer requirements are met. Data can't be copied when code is running code on an accelerator. The general form of this function is `copy(src, dest)`.|  \n|[copy_async Function](concurrency-namespace-functions-amp.md#copy_async)|Copies a C++ AMP object and returns [completion_future](completion-future-class.md) that can be waited on. Data can't be copied when code is running on an accelerator. The general form of this function is `copy(src, dest)`.|  \n|[direct3d_abort Function](concurrency-namespace-functions-amp.md#direct3d_abort)|Aborts the execution of a function that has the `restrict(amp)` restriction clause.|  \n|[direct3d_errorf Function](concurrency-namespace-functions-amp.md#direct3d_errorf)|Prints a formatted string to the Visual Studio **Output** window and raises a [runtime_exception](runtime-exception-class.md) exception that has the same formatting string.|  \n|[direct3d_printf Function](concurrency-namespace-functions-amp.md#direct3d_printf)|Prints a formatted string to the Visual Studio **Output** window. It is called from a function that has the `restrict(amp)` restriction clause.|  \n|[global_memory_fence Function](concurrency-namespace-functions-amp.md#global_memory_fence)|Blocks execution of all threads in a tile until all global memory accesses have been completed.|  \n|[parallel_for_each Function (C++ AMP)](concurrency-namespace-functions-amp.md#parallel_for_each)|Runs a function across the compute domain.|  \n|[tile_static_memory_fence Function](concurrency-namespace-functions-amp.md#tile_static_memory_fence)|Blocks execution of all threads in a tile until `tile_static` memory accesses have been completed.|  \n  \n## Constants  \n  \n|Name|Description|  \n|----------|-----------------|  \n|[HLSL_MAX_NUM_BUFFERS Constant](concurrency-namespace-constants-amp.md#hlsl_max_num_buffers)|The maximum number of buffers allowed by DirectX.|  \n|[MODULENAME_MAX_LENGTH Constant](concurrency-namespace-constants-amp.md#modulename_max_length)|Stores the maximum length of the module name. This value must be the same on the compiler and the runtime.|  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Header:** amp.h  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Reference (C++ AMP)](reference-cpp-amp.md)\n\n\n\n"}
