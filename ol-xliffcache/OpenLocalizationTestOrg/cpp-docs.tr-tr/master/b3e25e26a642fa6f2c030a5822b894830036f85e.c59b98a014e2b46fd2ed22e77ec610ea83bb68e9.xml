This file can then be the input to a process that creates documentation for the classes in your code.  \n  \n In a Visual C++ code file, XML documentation comments must be located directly prior to a method or type definition. The comments can be used to populate the Intellisense QuickInfo data tip in the following scenarios:  \n  \n1.  when the code is compiled as a Windows Runtime component with an accompanying .winmd file  \n  \n2.  when the source code is included in the current project  \n  \n3.  in a library whose type declarations and implementations are located in the same header file  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  In the current release, code comments are not processed on templates or anything containing a template type (for example, a function taking a parameter as a template). Adding such comments will result in undefined behavior.  \n  \n For details on creating an .xml file with documentation comments, see the following topics.  \n  \n|For information about|See|  \n|---------------------------|---------|  \n|The compiler options to use|[/doc](../build/reference/doc-process-documentation-comments-c-cpp.md)|  \n|Tags you can use to provide commonly used functionality in documentation|[Recommended Tags for Documentation Comments](../ide/recommended-tags-for-documentation-comments-visual-cpp.md)|  \n|The ID strings that the compiler produces to identify the constructs in your code|[Processing the .xml File](../ide/dot-xml-file-processing.md)|  \n|How to delimit documentation tags|[Delimiters for Visual C++ Documentation Tags](../ide/delimiters-for-visual-cpp-documentation-tags.md)|  \n|Generating an .xml file from one or more .xdc files.|[XDCMake Reference](../ide/xdcmake-reference.md)|  \n|Links to information about XML as it relates to Visual Studio feature areas|[XML in Visual Studio](/visualstudio/xml-tools/xml-tools-in-visual-studio)|  \n  \n If you need to put XML special characters in the text of a documentation comment, you must use XML entities or a CDATA section.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Component Extensions for Runtime Platforms](../windows/component-extensions-for-runtime-platforms.md)"}
