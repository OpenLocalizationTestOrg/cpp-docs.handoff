Because the framework does most of the frame-window work for you, you play only a small role in creating, using, and destroying those windows. You can, however, explicitly create your own frame windows and child windows for special purposes.  \n  \n## What do you want to know more about  \n  \n-   [Creating document frame windows](../mfc/creating-document-frame-windows.md)  \n  \n-   [When to Initialize CWnd Objects](../mfc/when-to-initialize-cwnd-objects.md)  \n  \n-   [Destroying frame windows](../mfc/destroying-frame-windows.md)  \n  \n-   [Managing MDI child windows](../mfc/managing-mdi-child-windows.md)  \n  \n-   [Managing the current view](../mfc/managing-the-current-view.md)  \n  \n-   [Managing menus, control bars, and accelerators](../mfc/managing-menus-control-bars-and-accelerators.md)  \n  \n-   [Dragging and dropping files in a frame window](../mfc/dragging-and-dropping-files-in-a-frame-window.md)  \n  \n-   [Responding to dynamic data exchange (DDE)](../mfc/responding-to-dynamic-data-exchange-dde.md)  \n  \n-   [Orchestrating other window actions](../mfc/orchestrating-other-window-actions.md)  \n  \n-   [Managing context-sensitive help](../mfc/orchestrating-other-window-actions.md)  \n  \n-   [The frame window's role in printing and print preview](../mfc/orchestrating-other-window-actions.md)  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Frame Windows](../mfc/frame-windows.md)\n\n"}
