You will create a window that contains two panes. The left pane will contain a [CMFCShellTreeCtrl](../mfc/reference/cmfcshelltreectrl-class.md) object that will display your Desktop in a hierarchical view. The right pane will contain a [CMFCShellListCtrl](../mfc/reference/cmfcshelllistctrl-class.md) that will show the files in the folder that is selected in the left pane.  \n  \n [Walkthrough: Putting Controls On Toolbars](../mfc/walkthrough-putting-controls-on-toolbars.md)  \n Modern MFC toolbars can host controls other than simple buttons. This article explains how to do it.  \n  \n [Walkthrough: Adding a D2D Object to an MFC Project](../mfc/walkthrough-adding-a-d2d-object-to-an-mfc-project.md)  \n Demonstrates how to add a D2D object to a project and introduces how to use D2D.  \n  \n [Walkthrough: Adding Animation to an MFC Project](../mfc/walkthrough-adding-animation-to-an-mfc-project.md)  \n Demonstrates how to add a graphical object to a project and introduces how to animate it.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [MFC Desktop Applications](../mfc/mfc-desktop-applications.md)\n\n"}
