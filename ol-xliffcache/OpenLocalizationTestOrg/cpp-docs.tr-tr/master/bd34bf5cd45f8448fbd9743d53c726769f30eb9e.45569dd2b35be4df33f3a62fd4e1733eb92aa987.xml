 \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  This class and its members cannot be used in applications that execute in the Windows Runtime.  \n  \n## Syntax  \n  \n```\ntemplate <class Worker>  class CNonStatelessWorker\n```  \n  \n#### Parameters  \n *Worker*  \n A worker thread class conforming to the [worker archetype](../../atl/reference/worker-archetype.md) suitable for handling requests

[CThreadPool](../../atl/reference/cthreadpool-class.md). This class doesn't provide any request-handling capabilities of its own. Instead, it instantiates one instance of *Worker* per request and delegates the implementation of its methods to that instance.  \n  \n The benefit of this class is that it provides a convenient way to change the state model for existing worker thread classes. `CThreadPool` will create a single worker for the lifetime of the thread, so if the worker class holds state, it will hold it across multiple requests. By simply wrapping that class in the `CNonStatelessWorker` template before using it with `CThreadPool`, the lifetime of the worker and the state it holds is limited to a single request.  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Header:** atlutil.h  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cnonstatelessworker__execute\"></a>  CNonStatelessWorker::Execute  \n Implementation of [WorkerArchetype::Execute](worker-archetype.md#workerarchetype__execute).  \n\n  \n```\nvoid Execute(\n    Worker::RequestType request,\n    void* pvWorkerParam,\n    OVERLAPPED* pOverlapped);\n```  \n  \n### Remarks  \n This method creates an instance of the *Worker* class on the stack and calls [Initialize](worker-archetype.md#workerarchetype__initialize) on that object.
