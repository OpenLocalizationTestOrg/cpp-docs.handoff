In [Resource view](../windows/resource-view-window.md) expand the resource folder (for example, Project1.rc).  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  If your project doesn't already contain an .rc file, please see [Creating a New Resource Script File](../windows/how-to-create-a-resource-script-file.md).  \n  \n2.  Expand the **Toolbar** folder and select a toolbar to edit.  \n  \n3.  Assign an ID to the blank button at the right end of the toolbar. You can do so by editing the **ID** property in the [Properties Window](/visualstudio/ide/reference/properties-window). For example, you may want to give a toolbar button the same ID as a menu option. In this case, use the drop-down list box to select the **ID** of the menu option.  \n  \n     –or–  \n  \n     Select the blank button at the right end of the toolbar (in the Toolbar View pane) and begin drawing. A default button command ID is assigned (ID_BUTTON\\<n>).  \n  \n You can also copy and paste an image onto a toolbar as a new button.  \n  \n#### To add an image to a toolbar as a button  \n  \n1.  In [Resource View](../windows/resource-view-window.md), open the toolbar by double-clicking it.  \n  \n2.  Next, open the image you'd like to add to your toolbar.  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  If you open the image in Visual Studio, it will open in the Image editor. You can also open the image in other graphics programs.  \n  \n3.  From the **Edit** menu, choose **Copy**.  \n  \n4.  Switch to your toolbar by clicking its tab at the top of the source window.  \n  \n5.  From the **Edit** menu, choose **Paste**.  \n  \n     The image will appear on your toolbar as a new button.  \n  \n For information on adding resources to managed projects, please see [Resources in Applications](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/8ad495d4-2941-40cf-bf64-e82e85825890) in the *.NET Framework Developer's Guide.* For information on manually adding resource files to managed projects, accessing resources, displaying static resources, and assigning resources strings to properties, see [Walkthrough: Localizing Windows Forms](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/9a96220d-a19b-4de0-9f48-01e5d82679e5) and [Walkthrough: Using Resources for Localization with ASP.NET](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/bb4e5b44-e2b0-48ab-bbe9-609fb33900b6).  \n  \n### Requirements  \n MFC or ATL  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Toolbar Button Properties](../mfc/toolbar-button-properties.md)   \n [Creating, Moving, and Editing Toolbar Buttons](../mfc/creating-moving-and-editing-toolbar-buttons.md)   \n [Toolbar Editor](../mfc/toolbar-editor.md)\n\n"}
