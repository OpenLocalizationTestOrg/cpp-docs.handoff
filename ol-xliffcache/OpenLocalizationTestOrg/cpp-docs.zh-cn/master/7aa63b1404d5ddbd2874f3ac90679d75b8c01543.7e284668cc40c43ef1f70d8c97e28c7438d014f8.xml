= 0  \n) throw( );  \n```  \n  \n#### Parameters  \n `session`  \n [in] The session in which to execute the command.  \n  \n `wszCommand`  \n [in] The command to execute, passed as a Unicode string. Can be **NULL** when using `CAccessor`, in which case the command will be retrieved from the value passed to the [DEFINE_COMMAND](../../data/oledb/define-command.md) macro. See [ICommand::Execute](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms718095.aspx) in the *OLE DB Programmer's Reference* for details.  \n  \n `szCommand`  \n [in] Same as `wszCommand` except that this parameter takes an ANSI command string. The fourth form of this method can take a NULL value. See \"Remarks\" later in this topic for details.  \n  \n *pPropSet*  \n [in] A pointer to an array of [DBPROPSET](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms714367.aspx) structures containing properties and values to be set. See [Property Sets and Property Groups](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms713696.aspx) in the *OLE DB Programmer's Reference* in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../../atl/includes/winsdk_md.md)].  \n  \n `pRowsAffected`  \n [in/out] A pointer to memory where the count of rows affected by a command is returned. If *\\*pRowsAffected* is **NULL**, no row count is returned. Otherwise, **Open** sets *`pRowsAffected` according to the following conditions:  \n  \n|If|Then|  \n|--------|----------|  \n|The **cParamSets** element of `pParams` is greater than 1|*`pRowsAffected` represents the total number of rows affected by all of the parameter sets specified in the execution.|  \n|The number of affected rows is not available|*`pRowsAffected` is set to –1.|  \n|The command does not update, delete, or insert rows|*`pRowsAffected` is undefined.|  \n  \n `guidCommand`  \n [in] A GUID that specifies the syntax and general rules for the provider to use in parsing the command text. See [ICommandText::GetCommandText](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms709825.aspx) and [ICommandText::SetCommandText](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms709757.aspx) in the *OLE DB Programmer's Reference* for details.  \n  \n `bBind`  \n [in] Specifies whether to bind the command automatically after being executed. The default is **true**, which causes the command to be bound automatically. Setting `bBind` to **false** prevents the automatic binding of the command so that you can bind manually. (Manual binding is of particular interest to OLAP users.)  \n  \n `ulPropSets`  \n [in] The number of [DBPROPSET](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms714367.aspx) structures passed in the *pPropSet* argument.  \n  \n## Return Value  \n A standard `HRESULT`.  \n  \n## Remarks  \n The first three forms of **Open** take a session, create a command, and execute the command, binding any parameters as necessary.  \n  \n The first form of **Open** takes a Unicode command string and has no default value.  \n  \n The second form of **Open** takes an ANSI command string and no default value (provided for backward compatibility with existing ANSI applications).  \n  \n The third form of **Open** allows the command string to be NULL, because of type `int` with a default value of NULL. It is provided for calling `Open(session, NULL);` or `Open(session);` because NULL is of type `int`. This version requires and asserts that the `int` parameter be NULL.  \n  \n Use the fourth form of **Open** when you have already created a command and you want to perform a single [Prepare](../../data/oledb/ccommand-prepare.md) and multiple executions.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  **Open** calls **Execute**, which in turn calls `GetNextResult`.  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Header:** atldbcli.h  \n  \n## See Also  \n [CCommand Class](../../data/oledb/ccommand-class.md)"}
