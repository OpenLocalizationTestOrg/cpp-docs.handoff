The Microsoft data controls provide a user interface consisting of a series of buttons to iterate through the data. Visual C++ offers two data access technologies for data controls: [ADO and RDO](../../data/ado-rdo/data-access-ado-and-rdo.md).  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  ADO and RDO data controls are an older technology that was released in a earlier version of Visual Studio, and might not be available in the current version. To use the information in this section, you might have to obtain a earlier release to acquire the appropriate control.  \n  \n **Data-bound controls**  \n A data-bound control is responsible for presenting the data. Data-bound controls connect to data controls to receive data and present the data through a variety of user interfaces. A Visual C++ application can also bind variables to data values set in the data-bound controls; see [CWnd::BindProperty](../mfc/reference/cwnd-class.md#cwnd__bindproperty).  \n  \n For more information about databinding, see:  \n  \n-   [MFC ActiveX Controls: Using Data Binding in an ActiveX Control](../../mfc/mfc-activex-controls-using-data-binding-in-an-activex-control.md)  \n  \n-   [Data Access: ADO and RDO](../../data/ado-rdo/data-access-ado-and-rdo.md)  \n  \n-   [ADO Databinding](../../data/ado-rdo/ado-databinding.md)  \n  \n-   [RDO Databinding](../../data/ado-rdo/rdo-databinding.md)  \n  \n-   [Wrapper Classes](../../data/ado-rdo/wrapper-classes.md)  \n  \n-   [Setting Event Handlers on ActiveX Controls](../../data/ado-rdo/setting-event-handlers-on-activex-controls.md)  \n  \n-   [Error Trapping](../../data/ado-rdo/error-trapping.md)  \n  \n-   [Limitations of Databinding](../../data/ado-rdo/limitations-of-databinding.md)  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Data-Bound Controls (ADO and RDO)](../../data/ado-rdo/data-bound-controls-ado-and-rdo.md)"}
