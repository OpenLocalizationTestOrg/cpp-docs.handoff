# Container Class::const_reference
> [!NOTE]
>  This topic is in the Visual C++ documentation as a nonfunctional example of containers used in the Standard C++ Library. For more information, see [STL Containers](../standard-library/stl-containers.md).  
  
 Describes an object that can serve as a constant reference to an element of the controlled sequence.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
 
typedef T3 const_reference;  
```  
  
## Remarks  
 It is described here as a synonym for the unspecified type **T3** (typically **Alloc::const_reference**).
