If you don't use serialization, you also won't need the File Open, Save, and Save As commands. Topics covered include:  \n  \n-   [Recommendations for handling input/output](../mfc/recommendations-for-handling-input-output.md)  \n  \n-   [Handling the File menu in database applications](../mfc/file-menu-in-an-mfc-database-application.md)  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Serialization](../mfc/serialization-in-mfc.md)\n\n"}
