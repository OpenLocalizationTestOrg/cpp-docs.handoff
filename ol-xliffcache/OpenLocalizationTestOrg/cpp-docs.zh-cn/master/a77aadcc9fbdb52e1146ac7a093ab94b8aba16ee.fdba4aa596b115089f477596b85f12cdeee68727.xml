The linker will continue to link the object without debug information. You may want to recompile the object file using the [/Zi](../../build/reference/z7-zi-zi-debug-information-format.md) option.  \n  \n LNK4204 can occur if some of the objects in the library refer to a file that no longer exists. This could happen when rebuilding the solution, for example; an object file might be deleted and not rebuilt because of a compilation error. In this case, either compile with **/Z7**, or **/Fd**, to update the objects to refer to a single file per-library (that is not the default .pdb file name).  For more information, see [/Fd (Program Database File Name)](../../build/reference/fd-program-database-file-name.md).  Ensure that the .pdb is saved with the library every time it is updated in the source control system."}
