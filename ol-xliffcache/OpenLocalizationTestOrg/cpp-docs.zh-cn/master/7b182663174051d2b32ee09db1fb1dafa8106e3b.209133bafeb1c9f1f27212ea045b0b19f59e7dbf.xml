To turn off trigraph substitution, specify **/Zc:trigraphs-**. By default, **/Zc:trigraphs** is off.  \n  \n## Syntax  \n  \n```  \n/Zc:trigraphs[-]  \n```  \n  \n## Remarks  \n A trigraph consists of two consecutive question marks (\"??\") followed by a unique third character. For example, the compiler replaces the \"??=\" trigraph by using the '#' character. Use trigraphs in C source files that use a character set that does not contain convenient graphic representations for some punctuation characters.  \n  \n For a list of C/C++ trigraphs, and an example that shows how to use trigraphs, see [Trigraphs](../../c-language/trigraphs.md).  \n  \n## See Also  \n [/Zc (Conformance)](../../build/reference/zc-conformance.md)   \n [Trigraphs](../../c-language/trigraphs.md)"}
