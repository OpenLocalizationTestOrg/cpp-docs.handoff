You use the container `vector` to manage a sequence of elements as a contiguous block of storage. The block is implemented as an array that grows on demand.  \n  \n In the description below, `GValue` is the same as `Value` unless the latter is a ref type, in which case it is `Value^`.  \n  \n##

Growth occurs in such a way that the cost of appending a new element is amortized constant time. In other words, the cost of adding elements at the end does not increase, on average, as the length of the controlled sequence gets larger. Thus, a vector is a good candidate for the underlying container for template class [stack (STL/CLR)](../dotnet/stack-stl-clr.md).  \n  \n A `vector` supports random-access iterators, which means you can refer to an element directly given its numerical position, counting from zero for the first (front) element, to [vector::size (STL/CLR)](../dotnet/vector-size-stl-clr.md)`() - 1` for the last (back) element. It also means that a vector is a good candidate for the underlying container for template class [priority_queue (STL/CLR)](../dotnet/priority-queue-stl-clr.md).  \n  \n A vector iterator stores a handle to its associated vector object, along with the bias of the element it designates. You can use iterators only with their associated container objects. The bias of a vector element is the same as its position.  \n  \n Inserting or erasing elements can change the element value stored at a given position, so the value designated by an iterator can also change. (The container may have to copy elements up or down to create a hole before an insert or to fill a hole after an erase.) Nevertheless, a vector iterator remains valid so long as its bias is in the range `[0,` [vector::size (STL/CLR)](../dotnet/vector-size-stl-clr.md)`()]`. Moreover, a valid iterator remains dereferencable -- you can use it to access or alter the element value it designates -- so long as its bias is not equal to `size()`.  \n  \n Erasing or removing an element calls the destructor for its stored value. Destroying the container erases all elements. Thus, a container whose element type is a ref class ensures that no elements outlive the container. Note, however, that a container of handles does `not` destroy its elements.  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Header:** \\<cliext/vector>  \n  \n **Namespace:** cliext  \n  \n## See Also  \n [deque (STL/CLR)](../dotnet/deque-stl-clr.md)   \n [list (STL/CLR)](../dotnet/list-stl-clr.md)   \n [priority_queue (STL/CLR)](../dotnet/priority-queue-stl-clr.md)   \n [queue (STL/CLR)](../dotnet/queue-stl-clr.md)   \n [stack (STL/CLR)](../dotnet/stack-stl-clr.md)   \n [STL/CLR Library Reference](../dotnet/stl-clr-library-reference.md)"}
