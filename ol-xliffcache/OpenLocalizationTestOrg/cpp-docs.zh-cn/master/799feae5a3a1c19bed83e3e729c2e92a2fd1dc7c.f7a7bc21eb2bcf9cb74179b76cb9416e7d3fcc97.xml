Use the `CTime` and `CTimeSpan` objects to calculate the elapsed time, as follows:  \n  \n     [!code-cpp[NVC_ATLMFC_Utilities#174](../atl-mfc-shared/codesnippet/cpp/elapsed-time-general-purpose-classes_1.cpp)]  \n  \n     Once you have calculated `elapsedTime`, you can use the member functions of `CTimeSpan` to extract the components of the elapsed-time value.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Date and Time: General-Purpose Classes](../atl-mfc-shared/date-and-time-general-purpose-classes.md)\n\n"}
