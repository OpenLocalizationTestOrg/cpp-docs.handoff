Structure\nThe `CDaoRelationFieldInfo` structure contains information about a field in a relation defined for data access objects (DAO).  \n  \n## Syntax  \n  \n```  \nstruct CDaoRelationFieldInfo  \n{  \n    CString m_strName;           // Primary  \n    CString m_strForeignName;    // Primary  \n};  \n```  \n  \n#### Parameters  \n `m_strName`  \n The name of the field in the primary table of the relation.  \n  \n `m_strForeignName`  \n The name of the field in the foreign table of the relation.  \n  \n## Remarks  \n A DAO relation object specifies the fields in a primary table and the fields in a foreign table that define the relation. The references to Primary in the structure definition above indicate how the information is returned in the `m_pFieldInfos` member of a [CDaoRelationInfo](../../mfc/reference/cdaorelationinfo-structure.md) object obtained by calling the [GetRelationInfo](../../mfc/reference/cdaodatabase-class.md#cdaodatabase__getrelationinfo) member function of class `CDaoDatabase`.  \n  \n Relation objects and relation field objects are not represented by an MFC class. Instead, the DAO objects underlying MFC objects of class [CDaoDatabase](../../mfc/reference/cdaodatabase-class.md) contain a collection of relation objects, called the Relations collection. Each relation object, in turn, contains a collection of relation field objects. Each relation field object correlates a field in the primary table with a field in the foreign table. Taken together, the relation field objects define a group of fields in each table, which together define the relation. `CDaoDatabase` lets you access relation objects with a `CDaoRelationInfo` object by calling the `GetRelationInfo` member function. The `CDaoRelationInfo` object, then, has a data member, `m_pFieldInfos`, that points to an array of `CDaoRelationFieldInfo` objects.  \n  \n Call the [GetRelationInfo](../../mfc/reference/cdaodatabase-class.md#cdaodatabase__getrelationinfo) member function of the containing `CDaoDatabase` object in whose Relations collection is stored the relation object you are interested in. Then access the `m_pFieldInfos` member of the [CDaoRelationInfo](../../mfc/reference/cdaorelationinfo-structure.md) object. `CDaoRelationFieldInfo` also defines a `Dump` member function in debug builds. You can use `Dump` to dump the contents of a `CDaoRelationFieldInfo` object.  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Header:** afxdao.h  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Structures, Styles, Callbacks, and Message Maps](../../mfc/reference/structures-styles-callbacks-and-message-maps.md)   \n [CDaoRelationInfo Structure](../../mfc/reference/cdaorelationinfo-structure.md)\n"}
