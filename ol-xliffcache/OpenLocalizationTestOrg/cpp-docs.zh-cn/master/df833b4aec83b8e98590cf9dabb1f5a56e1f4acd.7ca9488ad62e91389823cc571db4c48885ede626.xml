NMAKE ignores carets that precede other characters. The special characters are:  \n  \n `:  ;  #  (  )  $  ^  \\  {  }  !  @  â€”`  \n  \n A caret (^) within a quoted string is treated as a literal caret character. A caret at the end of a line inserts a literal newline character in a string or macro.  \n  \n In macros, a backslash (\\\\) followed by a newline character is replaced by a space.  \n  \n In commands, a percent symbol (%) is a file specifier. To represent % literally in a command, specify a double percent sign (%%) in place of a single one. In other situations, NMAKE interprets a single % literally, but it always interprets a double %% as a single %. Therefore, to represent a literal %%, specify either three percent signs, %%%, or four percent signs, %%%%.  \n  \n To use the dollar sign ($) as a literal character in a command, specify two dollar signs ($$). This method can also be used in other situations where ^$ works.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Contents of a Makefile](../build/contents-of-a-makefile.md)"}
