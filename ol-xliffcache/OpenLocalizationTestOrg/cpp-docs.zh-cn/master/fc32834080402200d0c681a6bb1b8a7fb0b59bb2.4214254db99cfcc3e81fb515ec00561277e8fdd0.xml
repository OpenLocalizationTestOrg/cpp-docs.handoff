When you do this, a declaration is added to the header file, and a stub member-function body is added to the class's implementation file, which you can then modify.  \n  \n### To add a member function to a class  \n  \n1.  In **Class View**, expand the project node to display the classes in the project. (To open **Class View**, on the menu bar, choose **View**, **Class View**.)  \n  \n2.  Open the shortcut menu for the class you want to add a member function to, and then choose **Add**, **Add Function**.  \n  \n3.  Provide the appropriate details about the member function. For more information, see [Add Member Function Wizard](../ide/add-member-function-wizard.md).  \n  \n4.  Choose the **Finish** button to generate the member function code.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Adding Functionality with Code Wizards](../ide/adding-functionality-with-code-wizards-cpp.md)   \n [Adding a Class](../ide/adding-a-class-visual-cpp.md)   \n [Adding a Member Variable](../ide/adding-a-member-variable-visual-cpp.md)   \n [Overriding a Virtual Function](../ide/overriding-a-virtual-function-visual-cpp.md)   \n [MFC Message Handler](../mfc/reference/adding-an-mfc-message-handler.md)   \n [Navigating the Class Structure](../ide/navigating-the-class-structure-visual-cpp.md)"}
