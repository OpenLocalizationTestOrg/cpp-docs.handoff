Type an ampersand (**&**) in front of a letter in the menu name or command name to specify that letter as the corresponding access key. For example \"&File\" sets ALT+F as the shortcut key for the File menu in applications written for Microsoft Windows.  \n  \n     The menu item will provide a visible cue that one of the letters has a shortcut key assigned to it. The letter following the ampersand will appear underlined (contingent on the operating system).  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  Make sure all the access keys on a menu are unique by right-clicking your menu and choosing **Check Mnemonics** from the shortcut menu.  \n  \n For information on adding resources to managed projects, please see [Resources in Applications](http://msdn.microsoft.com/Library/8ad495d4-2941-40cf-bf64-e82e85825890) in the *.NET Framework Developer's Guide.* For information on manually adding resource files to managed projects, accessing resources, displaying static resources, and assigning resources strings to properties, see [Walkthrough: Localizing Windows Forms](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/9a96220d-a19b-4de0-9f48-01e5d82679e5) and [Walkthrough: Using Resources for Localization with ASP.NET](http://msdn.microsoft.com/Library/bb4e5b44-e2b0-48ab-bbe9-609fb33900b6).  \n  \n Requirements  \n  \n Win32  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Menu Editor](../mfc/menu-editor.md)"}
