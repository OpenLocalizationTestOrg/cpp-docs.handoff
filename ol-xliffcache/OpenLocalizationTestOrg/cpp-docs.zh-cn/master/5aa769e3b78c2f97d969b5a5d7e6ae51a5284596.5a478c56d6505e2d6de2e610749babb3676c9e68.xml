Some operations on containers might also require a public default constructor and a public equivalence operator to be defined.  \n  \n Like reference types, value types and handles to reference types that are to be inserted into an associative container must have a comparison operator such as `operator<` defined. The requirements for a public copy constructor, public assignment operator, and a public destructor do not exist for value types or handles to reference types.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [C++ Standard Library Reference](../standard-library/cpp-standard-library-reference.md)"}
