This section covers some of the features of dual interfaces from an ATL perspective.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Implementing a Dual Interface](../atl/implementing-a-dual-interface.md)  \n Discusses the classes and wizards involved in implementing a dual interface.  \n  \n [Multiple Dual Interfaces](../atl/multiple-dual-interfaces.md)  \n Discusses how to expose multiple dual interfaces on a single object.  \n  \n [The nonextensible Attribute](../atl/nonextensible-attribute.md)  \n Discusses when to use the **nonextensible** attribute on your interface definition.  \n  \n [Dual Interfaces and Events](../atl/dual-interfaces-and-events.md)  \n Discusses design reasons for not making an event interface a dual interface.  \n  \n## Related Sections  \n [ATL](../atl/active-template-library-atl-concepts.md)  \n Provides links to conceptual topics on how to program using the Active Template Library.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Concepts](../atl/active-template-library-atl-concepts.md)\n\n"}
