This integration is handled by `COleDocObjectItem`.  \n  \n For more information on menu merging and Active document activation, see Overview of [Active Document Containment](../../mfc/active-document-containment.md).  \n  \n## Inheritance Hierarchy  \n [CObject](../../mfc/reference/cobject-class.md)  \n  \n [CCmdTarget](../../mfc/reference/ccmdtarget-class.md)  \n  \n [CDocItem](../../mfc/reference/cdocitem-class.md)  \n  \n [COleClientItem](../../mfc/reference/coleclientitem-class.md)  \n  \n `COleDocObjectItem`  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Header:** afxole.h  \n  \n##  <a name=\"coledocobjectitem__coledocobjectitem\"></a>  COleDocObjectItem::COleDocObjectItem  \n Call this member function to initialize the `COleDocObjectItem` object.  \n  \n```  \nCOleDocObjectItem(COleDocument* pContainerDoc = NULL);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `pContainerDoc`  \n A pointer to the `COleDocument` object acting as the active document container. This parameter must be **NULL** to enable **IMPLEMENT_SERIALIZE**. Normally OLE items are constructed with a non- **NULL** document pointer.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"coledocobjectitem__dodefaultprinting\"></a>  COleDocObjectItem::DoDefaultPrinting  \n Called by the framework to a document using the default settings.  \n  \n```  \nstatic HRESULT DoDefaultPrinting(\n    CView* pCaller,  \n    CPrintInfo* pInfo);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `pCaller`  \n A pointer to a [CView](../../mfc/reference/cview-class.md) object that is sending the print command.  \n  \n `pInfo`  \n A pointer to a [CPrintInfo](../../mfc/reference/cprintinfo-structure.md) object that describes the job to be printed.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"coledocobjectitem__execcommand\"></a>  COleDocObjectItem::ExecCommand  \n Call this member function to execute the command specified by the user.  \n  \n```  \nHRESULT ExecCommand(\n    DWORD nCmdID,  \n    DWORD nCmdExecOpt = OLECMDEXECOPT_DONTPROMPTUSER,  \n    const GUID* pguidCmdGroup = NULL);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `nCmdID`  \n The identifier of the command to execute. Must be in the group identified by `pguidCmdGroup`.  \n  \n `nCmdExecOpt`  \n Specifies command-execution options. By default, set to execute the command without prompting the user. See [OLECMDEXECOPT](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms683930) for a list of values.  \n  \n `pguidCmdGroup`  \n Unique identifier of the command group. By default, **NULL**, which specifies the standard group. The command passed in `nCmdID` must belong to the group.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Returns `S_OK` if successful; otherwise,returns one of the following error codes.  \n  \n|Value|Description|  \n|-----------|-----------------|  \n|**E_UNEXPECTED**|Unexpected error occurred.|  \n|**E_FAIL**|Error occurred.|  \n|**E_NOTIMPL**|Indicates MFC itself should attempt to translate and dispatch the command.|  \n|**OLECMDERR_E_UNKNOWNGROUP**|`pguidCmdGroup` is non- **NULL** but does not specify a recognized command group.|  \n|**OLECMDERR_E_NOTSUPPORTED**|`nCmdID` is not recognized as a valid command in the group pGroup.|  \n|**OLECMDERR_DISABLED**|The command identified by `nCmdID` is disabled and cannot be executed.|  \n|**OLECMDERR_NOHELP**|Caller asked for help on the command identified by `nCmdID` but no help is available.|  \n|**OLECMDERR_CANCELLED**|User canceled the execution.|  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The `pguidCmdGroup` and the `nCmdID` parameters together uniquely identify the command to invoke. The `nCmdExecOpt` parameter specifies the exact action to take.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"coledocobjectitem__getactiveview\"></a>  COleDocObjectItem::GetActiveView  \n Call this member function to get a pointer to the `IOleDocumentView` interface of the currently active view.  \n  \n```  \nLPOLEDOCUMENTVIEW GetActiveView() const;\n\n \n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n A pointer to the [IOleDocumentView](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms678455) interface of the currently active view. If there is no current view, it returns **NULL**.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The reference count on the returned `IOleDocumentView` pointer is not incremented before it is returned by this function.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"coledocobjectitem__getpagecount\"></a>  COleDocObjectItem::GetPageCount  \n Call this member function to retrieve the number of pages in the document.  \n  \n```  \nBOOL GetPageCount(\n    LPLONG pnFirstPage,  \n    LPLONG pcPages);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n *pnFirstPage*  \n A pointer to the number of the document's first page. Can be **NULL**, which indicates the caller doesn't need this number.  \n  \n *pcPages*  \n A pointer to the total number of pages in the document. Can be **NULL**, which indicates the caller doesn't need this number.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Nonzero if successful; otherwise 0.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"coledocobjectitem__onprepareprinting\"></a>  COleDocObjectItem::OnPreparePrinting  \n This member function is called by the framework to prepare a document for printing.  \n  \n```  \nstatic BOOL OnPreparePrinting(\n    CView* pCaller,  \n    CPrintInfo* pInfo,  \n    BOOL bPrintAll = TRUE);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `pCaller`  \n A pointer to a [CView](../../mfc/reference/cview-class.md) object that is sending the print command.  \n  \n `pInfo`  \n A pointer to a [CPrintInfo](../../mfc/reference/cprintinfo-structure.md) object that describes the job to be printed.  \n  \n `bPrintAll`  \n Specifies whether the entire document is to be printed.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Nonzero if successful; otherwise 0.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"coledocobjectitem__onprint\"></a>  COleDocObjectItem::OnPrint  \n This member function is called by the framework to print a document.  \n  \n```  \nstatic void OnPrint(\n    CView* pCaller,  \n    CPrintInfo* pInfo,  \n    BOOL bPrintAll = TRUE);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `pCaller`  \n A pointer to a CView object that is sending the print command.  \n  \n `pInfo`  \n A pointer to a [CPrintInfo](../../mfc/reference/cprintinfo-structure.md) object that describes the job to be printed.  \n  \n `bPrintAll`  \n Specifies whether the entire document is to be printed.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"coledocobjectitem__querycommand\"></a>  COleDocObjectItem::QueryCommand  \n Queries for the status of one or more commands generated by user interface events.  \n  \n```  \nHRESULT QueryCommand(\n    ULONG nCmdID,  \n    DWORD* pdwStatus,  \n    OLECMDTEXT* pCmdText =NULL,  \n    const GUID* pguidCmdGroup =NULL);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `nCmdID`  \n identifier of the command being queried for.  \n  \n `pdwStatus`  \n A pointer to the flags returned as a result of the query. For a list of possible values, see [OLECMDF](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms695237).  \n  \n `pCmdText`  \n Pointer to an [OLECMDTEXT](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms693314) structure in which to return name and status information for a single command. Can be **NULL** to indicate that the caller does not need this information.  \n  \n `pguidCmdGroup`  \n Unique identifier of the command group; can be **NULL** to specify the standard group.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n For a complete listing of return values, see [IOleCommandTarget::QueryStatus](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms688491) in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../../atl/includes/winsdk_md.md)].  \n  \n### Remarks  \n This member function emulates the functionality of the [IOleCommandTarget::QueryStatus](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms688491) method, as described in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../../atl/includes/winsdk_md.md)].  \n  \n##  <a name=\"coledocobjectitem__release\"></a>  COleDocObjectItem::Release  \n Releases the connection to an OLE linked item and closes it if it was open. Does not destroy the client item.  \n  \n```  \nvirtual void Release(OLECLOSE dwCloseOption = OLECLOSE_NOSAVE);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `dwCloseOption`  \n Flag specifying under what circumstances the OLE item is saved when it returns to the loaded state. For a list of possible values, see [COleClientItem::Close](../../mfc/reference/coleclientitem-class.md#coleclientitem__close).  \n  \n### Remarks  \n Does not destroy the client item.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [MFC Sample MFCBIND](../../visual-cpp-samples.md)   \n [COleClientItem Class](../../mfc/reference/coleclientitem-class.md)   \n [Hierarchy Chart](../../mfc/hierarchy-chart.md)   \n [COleClientItem Class](../../mfc/reference/coleclientitem-class.md)   \n [CDocObjectServerItem Class](../../mfc/reference/cdocobjectserveritem-class.md)\n"}
