The limit is one character for standard character constants and two characters for long character constants.  \n  \n An escape sequence, such as \\t, is converted to a single character.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following sample generates C2015:  \n  \n```  \n// C2015.cpp  \n// compile with: /c  \n  \nchar test1 = 'error';   // C2015  \nchar test2 = 'e';   // OK  \n```  \n  \n## Example  \n C2015 can also occur when using a Microsoft extension, character constants converted to integers.  The following sample generates C2015:  \n  \n```  \n// C2015b.cpp  \n#include <stdio.h>  \n  \nint main()   \n{  \n    int a = 'abcde';   // C2015  \n  \n    int b = 'a';   // 'a' = ascii 0x61  \n    printf_s(\"%x\\n\", b);  \n}  \n```"}
