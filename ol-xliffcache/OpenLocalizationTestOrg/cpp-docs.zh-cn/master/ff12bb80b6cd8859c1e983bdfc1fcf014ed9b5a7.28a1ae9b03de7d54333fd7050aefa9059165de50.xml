Since the conversions performed by the additive operators do not provide for overflow or underflow conditions, information may be lost if the result of an additive operation cannot be represented in the type of the operands after conversion.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Additive Operators: + and -](../cpp/additive-operators-plus-and.md)"}
