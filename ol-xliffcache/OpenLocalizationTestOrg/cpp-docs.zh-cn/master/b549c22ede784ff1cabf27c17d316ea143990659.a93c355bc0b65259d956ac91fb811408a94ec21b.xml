The **DCOMCNFG** window has three pages: Default Security, Default Properties, and Applications. Under Windows 2000 a fourth page, Default Protocols, is present.  \n  \n## Default Security Page  \n You can use the Default Security page to specify default permissions for objects on the system. The Default Security page has three sections: Access, Launch, and Configuration. To change a section's defaults, click the corresponding **Edit Default** button. These Default Security settings are stored in the registry under `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Microsoft\\OLE`.  \n  \n## Default Protocols Page  \n This page lists the set of network protocols available to DCOM on this machine. The order reflects the priority in which they will be used; the first in the list has the highest priority. Protocols can be added or deleted from this page.  \n  \n## Default Properties Page  \n On the Default Properties page, you must select the **Enable Distributed COM on this computer** check box if you want clients on other machines to access COM objects running on this machine. Selecting this option sets the `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Microsoft\\OLE\\EnableDCOM` value to `Y`.  \n  \n## Applications Page  \n You change the settings for a particular object with the Applications page. Simply select the application from the list and click the **Properties** button. The Properties window has five pages:  \n  \n-   The General page confirms the application you are working with.  \n  \n-   The Location page allows you to specify where the application should run when a client calls `CoCreateInstance` on the relevant CLSID. If you select the **Run application on the following computer** check box and enter a computer name, then a `RemoteServerName` value is added under the AppID for that application. Clearing the **Run application on this computer** check box renames the `LocalService` value to `_LocalService` and, thereby, disables it.  \n  \n-   The Security page is similar to the Default Security page found in the **DCOMCNFG** window, except that these settings apply only to the current application. Again, the settings are stored under the AppID for that object.  \n  \n-   The Identify page identifies which user is used to run the application.  \n  \n-   The Endpoints page lists the set of protocols and endpoints available for use by clients of the selected DCOM server.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Services](../atl/atl-services.md)\n\n"}
