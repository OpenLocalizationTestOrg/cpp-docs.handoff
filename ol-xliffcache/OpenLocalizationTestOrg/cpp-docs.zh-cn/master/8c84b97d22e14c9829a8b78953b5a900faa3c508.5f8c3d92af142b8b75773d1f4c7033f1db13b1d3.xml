Handle these messages if you want to do something in response. For example, when the user clicks a column header, you might want to sort the items based on the contents of the clicked column, as in Microsoft Outlook.  \n  \n Process **WM_NOTIFY** messages from the list control in your view or dialog class. Use the Properties window to create an [OnChildNotify](../mfc/reference/cwnd-class.md#cwnd__onchildnotify) handler function with a switch statement based on which notification message is being handled.  \n  \n For a list of the notifications a list control can send to its parent window, see [List View Control Reference](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb774737) in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../atl/includes/winsdk_md.md)].  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Using CListCtrl](../mfc/using-clistctrl.md)   \n [Controls](../mfc/controls-mfc.md)\n\n"}
