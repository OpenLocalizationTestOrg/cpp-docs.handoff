In this mode, you can:  \n  \n-   Type text, select from combo-box lists, turn options on or off, and choose commands.  \n  \n-   Test the tab order.  \n  \n-   Test the grouping of controls such as radio buttons and check boxes.  \n  \n-   Test the keyboard shortcuts for controls in the dialog box.  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  Connections to dialog box code made by using wizards are not included in the simulation.  \n  \n When you test a dialog box, it typically displays at a location that's relative to the main program window. If you've set the dialog box's Absolute Align property to True, the dialog box displays at a position that's relative to the upper-left corner of the screen.  \n  \n### To test a dialog box  \n  \n1.  When the Dialog editor is the active window, on the menu bar, choose **Format**, **Test Dialog**.  \n  \n2.  To end the simulation, press Esc, or just choose the **Close** button in the dialog box you are testing.  \n  \n For information about how to add resources to managed projects, see [Resources in Desktop Apps](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/8ad495d4-2941-40cf-bf64-e82e85825890).  \n  \n Requirements  \n  \n Win32  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Controls in Dialog Boxes](../mfc/controls-in-dialog-boxes.md)   \n [Dialog Editor](../mfc/dialog-editor.md)   \n [Showing or Hiding the Dialog Editor Toolbar](../mfc/showing-or-hiding-the-dialog-editor-toolbar.md)\n\n"}
