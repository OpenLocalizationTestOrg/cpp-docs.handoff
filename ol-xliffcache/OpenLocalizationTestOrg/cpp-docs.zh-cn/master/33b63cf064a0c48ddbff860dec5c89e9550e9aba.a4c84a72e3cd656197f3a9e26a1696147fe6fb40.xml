An escape sequence (such as **\\\\\\\\** or **\\\\\"**) within a string literal counts as a single character. A null character (represented by the **\\0** escape sequence) is automatically appended to, and marks the end of, each string literal. (This occurs during [translation phase](../preprocessor/phases-of-translation.md) 7.) Note that the compiler may not store two identical strings at two different addresses. [/GF](../build/reference/gf-eliminate-duplicate-strings.md) forces the compiler to place a single copy of identical strings into the executable file.  \n  \n## Remarks  \n **Microsoft Specific**  \n  \n Strings have static storage duration. See [Storage Classes](../c-language/c-storage-classes.md) for information about storage duration.  \n  \n **END Microsoft Specific**  \n  \n## See Also  \n [C String Literals](../c-language/c-string-literals.md)"}
