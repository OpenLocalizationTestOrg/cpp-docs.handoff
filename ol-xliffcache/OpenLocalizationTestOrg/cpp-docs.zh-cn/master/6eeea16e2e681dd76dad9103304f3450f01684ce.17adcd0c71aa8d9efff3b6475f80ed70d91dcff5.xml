The `SECTIONS` keyword can be on the same line as the first definition or on a preceding line. The .def file can contain one or more `SECTIONS` statements.  \n  \n This `SECTIONS` statement sets attributes for one or more sections in the image file, and can be used to override the default attributes for each type of section.  \n  \n The format for `definitions` is:  \n  \n `.section_name specifier`  \n  \n where `.section_name` is the name of a section in your program image and `specifier`is one or more of the following access modifiers:  \n  \n|Modifier|Description|  \n|--------------|-----------------|  \n|`EXECUTE`|The section is executable|  \n|`READ`|Allows read operations on data|  \n|`SHARED`|Shares the section among all processes that load the image|  \n|`WRITE`|Allows write operations on data|  \n  \n Separate specifier names with a space. For example:  \n  \n```  \nSECTIONS  \n.rdata READ WRITE  \n```  \n  \n `SECTIONS` marks the beginning of a list of section `definitions`. Each `definition` must be on a separate line. The `SECTIONS` keyword can be on the same line as the first `definition` or on a preceding line. The .def file can contain one or more `SECTIONS` statements. The `SEGMENTS` keyword is supported as a synonym for `SECTIONS`.  \n  \n Older versions of Visual C++ supported:  \n  \n```  \nsection [CLASS 'classname'] specifier  \n```  \n  \n The `CLASS` keyword is supported for compatibility, but is ignored.  \n  \n An equivalent way to specify section attributes is with the [/SECTION](../../build/reference/section-specify-section-attributes.md) option.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Rules for Module-Definition Statements](../../build/reference/rules-for-module-definition-statements.md)"}
