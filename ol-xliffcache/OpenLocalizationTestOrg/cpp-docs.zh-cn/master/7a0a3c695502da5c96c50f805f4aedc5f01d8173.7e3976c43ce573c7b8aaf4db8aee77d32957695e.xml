These versions of [getenv, _wgetenv](../../c-runtime-library/reference/getenv-wgetenv.md) have security enhancements, as described in [Security Features in the CRT](../../c-runtime-library/security-features-in-the-crt.md).  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  This API cannot be used in applications that execute in the [!INCLUDE[wrt](../../atl/reference/includes/wrt_md.md)]. For more information, see [CRT functions not supported with /ZW](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/jj606124.aspx).  \n  \n## Syntax  \n  \n```  \nerrno_t getenv_s(   \n   size_t *pReturnValue,  \n   char* buffer,  \n   size_t numberOfElements,  \n   const char *varname   \n);  \nerrno_t _wgetenv_s(   \n   size_t *pReturnValue,  \n   wchar_t *buffer,  \n   size_t numberOfElements,  \n   const wchar_t *varname   \n);  \ntemplate <size_t size>  \nerrno_t getenv_s(   \n   size_t *pReturnValue,  \n   char (&buffer)[size],  \n   const char *varname   \n); // C++ only  \ntemplate <size_t size>  \nerrno_t _wgetenv_s(   \n   size_t *pReturnValue,  \n   wchar_t (&buffer)[size],  \n   const wchar_t *varname   \n); // C++ only  \n```  \n  \n#### Parameters  \n `pReturnValue`  \n The buffer size that's required, or 0 if the variable is not found.  \n  \n `buffer`  \n Buffer to store the value of the environment variable.  \n  \n `numberOfElements`  \n Size of `buffer`.  \n  \n `varname`  \n Environment variable name.  \n  \n## Return Value  \n Zero if successful; otherwise, an error code on failure.  \n  \n### Error Conditions  \n  \n|`pReturnValue`|`buffer`|`numberOfElements`|`varname`|Return Value|  \n|--------------------|--------------|------------------------|---------------|------------------|  \n|`NULL`|any|any|any|`EINVAL`|  \n|any|`NULL`|>0|any|`EINVAL`|  \n|any|any|any|`NULL`|`EINVAL`|  \n  \n Any of these error conditions invokes an invalid parameter handler, as described in [Parameter Validation](../../c-runtime-library/parameter-validation.md). If execution is allowed to continue, the functions set `errno` to `EINVAL` and return `EINVAL`.  \n  \n Also, if the buffer is too small, these functions return `ERANGE`. They do not invoke an invalid parameter handler. They write out the required buffer size in `pReturnValue`, and thereby enable programs to call the function again with a larger buffer.  \n  \n## Remarks  \n The `getenv_s` function searches the list of environment variables for `varname`. `getenv_s` is not case sensitive in the Windows operating system. `getenv_s` and `_putenv_s` use the copy of the environment that's pointed to by the global variable `_environ` to access the environment. `getenv_s` operates only on the data structures that are accessible to the run-time library and not on the environment \"segment\" that's created for the process by the operating system. Therefore, programs that use the `envp` argument to [main](../../cpp/main-program-startup.md) or [wmain](../../cpp/main-program-startup.md) might retrieve invalid information.  \n  \n `_wgetenv_s` is a wide-character version of `getenv_s`; the argument and return value of `_wgetenv_s` are wide-character strings. The `_wenviron` global variable is a wide-character version of `_environ`.  \n  \n In an MBCS program (for example, in an SBCS ASCII program), `_wenviron` is initially `NULL` because the environment is composed of multibyte-character strings. Then, on the first call to `_wputenv`, or on the first call to `_wgetenv_s`, if an (MBCS) environment already exists, a corresponding wide-character string environment is created and is then pointed to by `_wenviron`.  \n  \n Similarly in a Unicode `(_wmain`) program, `_environ` is initially `NULL` because the environment is composed of wide-character strings. Then, on the first call to `_putenv`, or on the first call to `getenv_s` if a (Unicode) environment already exists, a corresponding MBCS environment is created and is then pointed to by `_environ`.  \n  \n When two copies of the environment (MBCS and Unicode) exist simultaneously in a program, the run-time system must maintain both copies, and this causes slower execution time. For example, when you call `_putenv`, a call to `_wputenv` is also executed automatically so that the two environment strings correspond.  \n  \n> [!CAUTION]\n>  In rare instances, when the run-time system is maintaining both a Unicode version and a multibyte version of the environment, the two environment versions may not correspond exactly. This happens because, although any unique multibyte-character string maps to a unique Unicode string, the mapping from a unique Unicode string to a multibyte-character string is not necessarily unique. For more information, see [_environ, _wenviron](../../c-runtime-library/environ-wenviron.md).  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The `_putenv_s` and `_getenv_s` families of functions are not thread-safe. `_getenv_s` could return a string pointer while `_putenv_s` is modifying the string and thereby cause random failures. Make sure that calls to these functions are synchronized.  \n  \n In C++, use of these functions is simplified by template overloads; the overloads can infer buffer length automatically and thereby eliminate the need to specify a size argument. For more information, see [Secure Template Overloads](../../c-runtime-library/secure-template-overloads.md).  \n  \n### Generic-Text Routine Mappings  \n  \n|TCHAR.H routine|_UNICODE & _MBCS not defined|_MBCS defined|_UNICODE defined|  \n|---------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|  \n|`_tgetenv_s`|`getenv_s`|`getenv_s`|`_wgetenv_s`|  \n  \n To check or change the value of the `TZ` environment variable, use `getenv_s`, `_putenv`, and `_tzset`, as required.
