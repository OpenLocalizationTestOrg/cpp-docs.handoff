CFirePropNotifyEvent Class\nThis class provides methods for notifying the container's sink regarding control property changes.  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  This class and its members cannot be used in applications that execute in the Windows Runtime.  \n  \n## Syntax  \n  \n```\nclass CFirePropNotifyEvent\n```  \n  \n## Members  \n  \n### Public Methods  \n  \n|Name|Description|  \n|----------|-----------------|  \n|[CFirePropNotifyEvent::FireOnChanged](#cfirepropnotifyevent__fireonchanged)|(Static) Notifies the container's sink that a control property has changed.|  \n|[CFirePropNotifyEvent::FireOnRequestEdit](#cfirepropnotifyevent__fireonrequestedit)|(Static) Notifies the container's sink that a control property is about to change.|  \n  \n## Remarks  \n `CFirePropNotifyEvent` has two methods that notify the container's sink that a control property has changed or is about to change.  \n  \n If the class implementing your control is derived from `IPropertyNotifySink`, the `CFirePropNotifyEvent` methods are invoked when you call `FireOnRequestEdit` or `FireOnChanged`. If your control class is not derived from `IPropertyNotifySink`, calls to these functions return `S_OK`.  \n  \n For more information about creating controls, see the [ATL Tutorial](../../atl/active-template-library-atl-tutorial.md).  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Header:** atlctl.h  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cfirepropnotifyevent__fireonchanged\"></a>  CFirePropNotifyEvent::FireOnChanged  \n Notifies all connected [IPropertyNotifySink](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms692638) interfaces (on every connection point of the object) that the specified object property has changed.  \n  \n```\nstatic HRESULT FireOnChanged(\n    IUnknown* pUnk,  DISPID dispID);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n *pUnk*  \n [in] Pointer to the **IUnknown** of the object sending the notification.  \n  \n *dispID*  \n [in] Identifier of the property that has changed.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n One of the standard `HRESULT` values.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n This function is safe to call even if your control does not support connection points.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cfirepropnotifyevent__fireonrequestedit\"></a>  CFirePropNotifyEvent::FireOnRequestEdit  \n Notifies all connected [IPropertyNotifySink](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms692638) interfaces (on every connection point of the object) that the specified object property is about to change.  \n  \n```\nstatic HRESULT FireOnRequestEdit(\n    IUnknown* pUnk,  DISPID dispID);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n *pUnk*  \n [in] Pointer to the **IUnknown** of the object sending the notification.  \n  \n *dispID*  \n [in] Identifier of the property about to change.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n One of the standard `HRESULT` values.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n This function is safe to call even if your control does not support connection points.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Class Overview](../../atl/atl-class-overview.md)\n"}
