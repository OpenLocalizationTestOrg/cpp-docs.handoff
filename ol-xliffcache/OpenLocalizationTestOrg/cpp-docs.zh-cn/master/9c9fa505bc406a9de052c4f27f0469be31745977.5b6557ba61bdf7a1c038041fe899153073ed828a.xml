Typically, you want to constrain the record selection with a [filter](../data/odbc/recordset-filtering-records-odbc.md) or [parameters](../data/odbc/recordset-parameterizing-a-recordset-odbc.md), perhaps [sort](../data/odbc/recordset-sorting-records-odbc.md) the records, customize the SQL statement.  \n  \n This information applies to both [CRecordView](../mfc/reference/crecordview-class.md) (ODBC) and [CDaoRecordView](../mfc/reference/cdaorecordview-class.md) (DAO).  \n  \n Using `CRecordView` or `CDaoRecordView` is much the same as using [CFormView](../mfc/reference/cformview-class.md). The basic approach is to use the record view to display and perhaps update the records of a single recordset. Beyond that, you might want to use other recordsets as well, as discussed in [Record Views: Filling a List Box from a Second Recordset](../data/filling-a-list-box-from-a-second-recordset-mfc-data-access.md).  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Record Views  (MFC Data Access)](../data/record-views-mfc-data-access.md)   \n [ODBC Driver List](../data/odbc/odbc-driver-list.md)"}
