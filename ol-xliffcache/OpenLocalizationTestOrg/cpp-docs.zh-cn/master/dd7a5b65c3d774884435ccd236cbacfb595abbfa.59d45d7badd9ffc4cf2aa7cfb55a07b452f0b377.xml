When you derive a class from [CRecordset](../../mfc/reference/crecordset-class.md) and do not use bulk row fetching, data is transferred by the record field exchange (RFX) mechanism.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  If you have implemented bulk row fetching in a derived `CRecordset` class, the framework uses the bulk record field exchange (Bulk RFX) mechanism to transfer data. For more information, see [Recordset: Fetching Records in Bulk (ODBC)](../../data/odbc/recordset-fetching-records-in-bulk-odbc.md).  \n  \n RFX is similar to dialog data exchange (DDX). Moving data between a data source and the field data members of a recordset requires multiple calls to the recordset's [DoFieldExchange](../../mfc/reference/crecordset-class.md#crecordset__dofieldexchange) function and considerable interaction between the framework and [ODBC](../../data/odbc/odbc-basics.md). The RFX mechanism is type-safe and saves you the work of calling ODBC functions such as **::SQLBindCol**. For more information about DDX, see [Dialog Data Exchange and Validation](../../mfc/dialog-data-exchange-and-validation.md).  \n  \n RFX is mostly transparent to you. If you declare your recordset classes with the MFC Application Wizard or **Add Class** (as described in [Adding an MFC ODBC Consumer](../../mfc/reference/adding-an-mfc-odbc-consumer.md)), RFX is built into them automatically. Your recordset class must be derived from the base class `CRecordset` supplied by the framework. The MFC Application Wizard lets you create an initial recordset class. **Add Class** lets you add other recordset classes as you need them. For more information and examples, see [Adding an MFC ODBC Consumer](../../mfc/reference/adding-an-mfc-odbc-consumer.md).  \n  \n You must manually add a small amount of RFX code in three cases, when you want to:  \n  \n-   Use parameterized queries. For more information, see [Recordset: Parameterizing a Recordset (ODBC)](../../data/odbc/recordset-parameterizing-a-recordset-odbc.md).  \n  \n-   Perform joins (using one recordset for columns from two or more tables). For more information, see [Recordset: Performing a Join (ODBC)](../../data/odbc/recordset-performing-a-join-odbc.md).  \n  \n-   Bind data columns dynamically. This is less common than parameterization. For more information, see [Recordset: Dynamically Binding Data Columns (ODBC)](../../data/odbc/recordset-dynamically-binding-data-columns-odbc.md).  \n  \n If you need a more advanced understanding of RFX, see [Record Field Exchange: How RFX Works](../../data/odbc/record-field-exchange-how-rfx-works.md).  \n  \n The following topics explain the details of using recordset objects:  \n  \n-   [Record Field Exchange: Using RFX](../../data/odbc/record-field-exchange-using-rfx.md)  \n  \n-   [Record Field Exchange: Using the RFX Functions](../../data/odbc/record-field-exchange-using-the-rfx-functions.md)  \n  \n-   [Record Field Exchange: How RFX Works](../../data/odbc/record-field-exchange-how-rfx-works.md)  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Open Database Connectivity (ODBC)](../../data/odbc/open-database-connectivity-odbc.md)   \n [Recordset (ODBC)](../../data/odbc/recordset-odbc.md)   \n [MFC ODBC Consume](../../mfc/reference/adding-an-mfc-odbc-consumer.md)   \n [Database Support, MFC Application Wizard](../../mfc/reference/database-support-mfc-application-wizard.md)   \n [CRecordset Class](../../mfc/reference/crecordset-class.md)"}
