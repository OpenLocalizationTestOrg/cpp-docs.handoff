You can accomplish this by getting the <xref:System.Environment.MachineName%2A> string, which is defined in the <xref:System.Environment> namespace.  \n  \n## Example  \n  \n```  \n// machine_name.cpp  \n// compile with: /clr  \nusing namespace System;  \n  \nint main()   \n{  \n   Console::WriteLine(\"\\nMachineName: {0}\", Environment::MachineName);  \n   return 0;  \n}  \n```  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Windows Operations (C++/CLI)](../dotnet/windows-operations-cpp-cli.md)   \n [.NET Programming with C++/CLI (Visual C++)](../dotnet/dotnet-programming-with-cpp-cli-visual-cpp.md)"}
