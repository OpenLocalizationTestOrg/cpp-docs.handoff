The following list shows the order of precedence from highest to lowest:  \n  \n1.  An inference rule defined in a makefile; later definitions have precedence.  \n  \n2.  An inference rule defined in Tools.ini; later definitions have precedence.  \n  \n3.  A predefined inference rule.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Inference Rules](../build/inference-rules.md)"}
