These child windows, often other controls, are assigned to a rebar control band. A rebar control can contain one or more bands, with each band having any combination of a gripper bar, a bitmap, a text label, and a child window. However, bands cannot contain more than one child window.  \n  \n The following illustration shows a rebar control that has two bands. One contains a gripper bar, a text label (\"Address\"), and a combo box child window. The other band contains a gripper bar, a text label, and a flat toolbar (implemented with a child window).  \n  \n ![Rebar control that has two bands](../mfc/media/vc4ruz1.gif \"vc4ruz1\")  \n  \n## What do you want to know more about  \n  \n-   [CReBar vs. CReBarCtrl](../mfc/crebar-vs-crebarctrl.md)  \n  \n-   [Creating a Rebar Control](../mfc/creating-a-rebar-control.md)  \n  \n-   [Rebar Controls and Bands](../mfc/rebar-controls-and-bands.md)  \n  \n-   [Using an Image List with a Rebar Control](../mfc/using-an-image-list-with-a-rebar-control.md)  \n  \n-   [Using a Dialog Bar with a Rebar Control](../mfc/using-a-dialog-bar-with-a-rebar-control.md)  \n  \n-   [Processing Notification Messages in a Rebar Control](../mfc/processing-notification-messages-in-a-rebar-control.md)  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Controls](../mfc/controls-mfc.md)\n\n"}
