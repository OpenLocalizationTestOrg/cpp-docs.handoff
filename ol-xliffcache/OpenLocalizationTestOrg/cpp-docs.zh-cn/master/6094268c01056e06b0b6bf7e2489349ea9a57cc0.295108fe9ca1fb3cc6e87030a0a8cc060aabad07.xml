Basics\nMicrosoft provides many APIs for programming both client and server applications. Many new applications are being written for the Internet, and as technologies, browser capabilities, and security options change, new types of applications will be written. Browsers run on client computers, providing access to the World Wide Web and displaying HTML pages that contain text, graphics, ActiveX controls, and documents. Servers provide FTP, HTTP, and gopher services, and run server extension applications using CGI. Your custom application can retrieve information and provide data on the Internet.  \n  \n ![Client and server applications](../mfc/media/vc38bq1.gif \"vc38bq1\")  \n  \n MFC provides classes that support Internet programming. You can use [COleControl](../mfc/reference/colecontrol-class.md) and [CDocObjectServer](../mfc/reference/cdocobjectserver-class.md) and related MFC classes to write ActiveX controls and Active documents. You can use MFC classes such as [CInternetSession](../mfc/reference/cinternetsession-class.md), [CFtpConnection](../mfc/reference/cftpconnection-class.md), and [CAsyncMonikerFile](../mfc/reference/casyncmonikerfile-class.md) to retrieve files and information using Internet protocols such as FTP, HTTP, and gopher.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n  \n-   [Internet-Related MFC Classes](../mfc/internet-related-mfc-classes.md)  \n  \n-   [Internet Information by Topic](../mfc/internet-information-by-topic.md)  \n  \n-   [Internet Information by Task](../mfc/internet-information-by-task.md)  \n  \n-   [Active Technology on the Internet](../mfc/active-technology-on-the-internet.md)  \n  \n-   [WinInet Basics](../mfc/wininet-basics.md)  \n  \n-   [HTML Basics](../mfc/html-basics.md)  \n  \n-   [HTTP Basics](../mfc/http-basics.md)  \n  \n## Related Sections  \n  \n-   [ActiveX Controls on the Internet](../mfc/activex-controls-on-the-internet.md)  \n  \n-   [Active Documents on the Internet](../mfc/active-documents-on-the-internet.md)  \n  \n-   [Asynchronous Monikers on the Internet](../mfc/asynchronous-monikers-on-the-internet.md)  \n  \n-   [Win32 Internet Extensions (WinInet)](../mfc/win32-internet-extensions-wininet.md)  \n  \n-   [MFC Internet Programming Tasks](../mfc/mfc-internet-programming-tasks.md)  \n  \n-   [Application Design Choices](../mfc/application-design-choices.md)  \n  \n-   [Writing MFC Applications](../mfc/writing-mfc-applications.md)  \n  \n-   [Testing Internet Applications](../mfc/testing-internet-applications.md)  \n  \n-   [Internet Security](../mfc/internet-security-cpp.md)  \n  \n-   [ATL Support for DHTML Controls](../atl/atl-support-for-dhtml-controls.md)  \n  \n##  <a name=\"_core_web_sites_for_more_information\"></a> Web Sites for More Information  \n For additional information about Microsoft Internet technology, see the [Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN)](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/linkid=56322) Web site.
