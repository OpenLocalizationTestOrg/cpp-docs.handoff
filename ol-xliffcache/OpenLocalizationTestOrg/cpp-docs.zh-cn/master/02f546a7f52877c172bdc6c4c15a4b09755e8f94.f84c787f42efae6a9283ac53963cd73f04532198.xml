For example, if any element of an array is pinned, then the whole array is also pinned. There are no extensions to the language for declaring a pinned array. To pin an array, declare a pinning pointer to its element type, and pin one of its elements.  \n  \n## Example  \n  \n### Code  \n  \n```  \n// pin_ptr_array.cpp  \n// compile with: /clr  \n#include <stdio.h>  \nusing namespace System;  \n  \nint main() {  \n   array<Byte>^ arr = gcnew array<Byte>(4);  \n   arr[0] = 'C';  \n   arr[1] = '+';  \n   arr[2] = '+';  \n   arr[3] = '\\0';  \n   pin_ptr<Byte> p = &arr[1];   // entire array is now pinned  \n   unsigned char * cp = p;  \n  \n   printf_s(\"%s\\n\", cp); // bytes pointed at by cp  \n                         // will not move during call  \n}  \n```  \n  \n### Output  \n  \n```  \n++  \n```  \n  \n## See Also  \n [pin_ptr (C++/CLI)](../windows/pin-ptr-cpp-cli.md)"}
