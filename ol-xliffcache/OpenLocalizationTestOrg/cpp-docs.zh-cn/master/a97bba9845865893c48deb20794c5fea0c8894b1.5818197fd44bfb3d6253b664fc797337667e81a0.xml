NMAKE attempts to use an inference rule for such targets.  \n  \n For example, this set of rules,  \n  \n```Output  \nleap.exe bounce.exe : jump.obj  \nbounce.exe climb.exe : up.obj  \n   echo Building bounce.exe...  \n```  \n  \n is evaluated as this:  \n  \n```Output  \n  \nleap.exe : jump.obj  \n# invokes an inference rule  \nbounce.exe : jump.obj up.obj  \n   echo Building bounce.exe...  \nclimb.exe : up.obj  \n   echo Building bounce.exe...  \n```  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Targets](../build/targets.md)"}
