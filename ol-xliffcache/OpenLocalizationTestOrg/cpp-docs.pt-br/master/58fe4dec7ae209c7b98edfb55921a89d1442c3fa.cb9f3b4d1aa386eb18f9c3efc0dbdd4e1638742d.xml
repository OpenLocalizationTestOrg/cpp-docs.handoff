You use it to insert a single element before a place designated by an iterator.  \n  \n The second member function inserts a repetition of `count` elements of value `val`. You use it to insert zero or more contiguous elements which are all copies of the same value.  \n  \n If `InIt` is an integer type, the third member function behaves the same as `insert(``where``, (size_type)``first``, (value_type)``last``)`. Otherwise, it inserts the sequence `[``first``,` `last``)`. You use it to insert zero or more contiguous elements copied from another sequence.  \n  \n The fourth member function inserts the sequence designated by the `right`. You use it to insert a sequence described by an enumerator.  \n  \n When inserting a single element, the number of element copies is linear in the number of elements between the insertion point and the nearer end of the sequence. (When inserting one or more elements at either end of the sequence, no element copies occur.) If `InIt` is an input iterator, the third member function effectively performs a single insertion for each element in the sequence. Otherwise, when inserting `N` elements, the number of element copies is linear in `N` plus the number of elements between the insertion point and the nearer end of the sequence.  \n  \n## Example  \n  \n```  \n// cliext_deque_insert.cpp   \n// compile with: /clr   \n#include <cliext/deque>   \n  \nint main()   \n    {   \n    cliext::deque<wchar_t> c1;   \n    c1.push_back(L'a');   \n    c1.push_back(L'b');   \n    c1.push_back(L'c');   \n  \n// display initial contents \" a b c\"   \n    for each (wchar_t elem in c1)   \n        System::Console::Write(\" {0}\", elem);   \n    System::Console::WriteLine();   \n  \n// insert a single value using iterator   \n    cliext::deque<wchar_t>::iterator it = c1.begin();   \n    System::Console::WriteLine(\"insert(begin()+1, L'x') = {0}\",   \n        *c1.insert(++it, L'x'));   \n    for each (wchar_t elem in c1)   \n        System::Console::Write(\" {0}\", elem);   \n    System::Console::WriteLine();   \n  \n// insert a repetition of values   \n    cliext::deque<wchar_t> c2;   \n    c2.insert(c2.begin(), 2, L'y');   \n    for each (wchar_t elem in c2)   \n        System::Console::Write(\" {0}\", elem);   \n    System::Console::WriteLine();   \n  \n// insert an iterator range   \n    it = c1.end();   \n    c2.insert(c2.end(), c1.begin(), --it);   \n    for each (wchar_t elem in c2)   \n        System::Console::Write(\" {0}\", elem);   \n    System::Console::WriteLine();   \n  \n// insert an enumeration   \n    c2.insert(c2.begin(),   // NOTE: cast is not needed   \n        (System::Collections::Generic::IEnumerable<wchar_t>^)%c1);   \n    for each (wchar_t elem in c2)   \n        System::Console::Write(\" {0}\", elem);   \n    System::Console::WriteLine();   \n    return (0);   \n    }  \n  \n```  \n  \n```Output  \n a b c  \ninsert(begin()+1, L'x') = x  \n a x b c  \n y y  \n y y a x b  \n a x b c y y a x b  \n```  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Header:** \\<cliext/deque>  \n  \n **Namespace:** cliext  \n  \n## See Also  \n [deque (STL/CLR)](../dotnet/deque-stl-clr.md)   \n [deque::assign (STL/CLR)](../dotnet/deque-assign-stl-clr.md)"}
