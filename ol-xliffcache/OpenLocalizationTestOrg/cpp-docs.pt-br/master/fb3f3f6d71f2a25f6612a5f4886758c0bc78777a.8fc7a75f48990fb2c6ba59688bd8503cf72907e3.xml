If you create additional windows, you are responsible for destroying them.  \n  \n In the framework, when the user closes the frame window, the window's default [OnClose](../mfc/reference/cwnd-class.md#cwnd__onclose) handler calls [DestroyWindow](../mfc/reference/cwnd-class.md#cwnd__destroywindow). The last member function called when the Windows window is destroyed is [OnNcDestroy](../mfc/reference/cwnd-class.md#cwnd__onncdestroy), which does some cleanup, calls the [Default](../mfc/reference/cwnd-class.md#cwnd__default) member function to perform Windows cleanup, and lastly calls the virtual member function [PostNcDestroy](../mfc/reference/cwnd-class.md#cwnd__postncdestroy). The [CFrameWnd](../mfc/reference/cframewnd-class.md) implementation of `PostNcDestroy` deletes the C++ window object. You should never use the C++ **delete** operator on a frame window. Use `DestroyWindow` instead.  \n  \n When the main window closes, the application closes. If there are modified unsaved documents, the framework displays a message box to ask if the documents should be saved and ensures that the appropriate documents are saved if necessary.  \n  \n## What do you want to know more about  \n  \n-   [Creating document frame windows](../mfc/creating-document-frame-windows.md)  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Using Frame Windows](../mfc/using-frame-windows.md)\n\n"}
