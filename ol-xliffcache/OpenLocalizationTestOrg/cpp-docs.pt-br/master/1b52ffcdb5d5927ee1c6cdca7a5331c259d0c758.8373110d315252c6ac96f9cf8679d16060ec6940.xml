[CWindow](../atl/reference/cwindow-class.md) allows you to attach a window handle to the `CWindow` object. You then call `CWindow` methods to manipulate the window.  \n  \n-   [CWindowImpl](../atl/reference/cwindowimpl-class.md) allows you to implement a new window and process messages with a message map. You can create a window based on a new Windows class, superclass an existing class, or subclass an existing window.  \n  \n-   [CDialogImpl](../atl/reference/cdialogimpl-class.md) allows you to implement a modal or a modeless dialog box and process messages with a message map.  \n  \n-   [CContainedWindowT](../atl/reference/ccontainedwindowt-class.md) is a prebuilt class that implements a window whose message map is contained in another class. Using `CContainedWindowT` allows you to centralize message processing in one class.  \n  \n-   [CAxDialogImpl](../atl/reference/caxdialogimpl-class.md) allows you to implement a dialog box (modal or modeless) that hosts ActiveX controls.  \n  \n-   [CSimpleDialog](../atl/reference/csimpledialog-class.md) allows you to implement a modal dialog box with basic functionality.  \n  \n-   [CAxWindow](../atl/reference/caxwindow-class.md) allows you to implement a window that hosts an ActiveX control.  \n  \n-   [CAxWindow2T](../atl/reference/caxwindow2t-class.md) allows you to implement a window that hosts a licensed ActiveX control.  \n  \n In addition to specific window classes, ATL provides several classes designed to make the implementation of an ATL window object easier. They are as follows:  \n  \n-   [CWndClassInfo](../atl/reference/cwndclassinfo-class.md) manages the information of a new window class.  \n  \n-   [CWinTraits](../atl/reference/cwintraits-class.md) and [CWinTraitsOR](../atl/reference/cwintraitsor-class.md) provide a simple method of standardizing the traits of an ATL window object.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Window Classes](../atl/atl-window-classes.md)\n\n"}
