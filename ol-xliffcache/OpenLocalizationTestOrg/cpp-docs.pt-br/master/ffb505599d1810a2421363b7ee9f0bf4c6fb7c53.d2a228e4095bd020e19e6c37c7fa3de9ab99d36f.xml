It is not 0 if the application should redraw the background. The application is responsible for drawing the background if a Windows window-class is created without a background brush (see the description of the **hbrBackground** member of the [WNDCLASS](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms633576) structure in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../../atl/includes/winsdk_md.md)]).  \n  \n *rcPaint*  \n Specifies the upper left and lower right corners of the rectangle in which the painting is requested.  \n  \n *fRestore*  \n Reserved member. It is used internally by Windows.  \n  \n *fIncUpdate*  \n Reserved member. It is used internally by Windows.  \n  \n *rgbReserved[16]*  \n Reserved member. A reserved block of memory used internally by Windows.  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Header:** winuser.h  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Structures, Styles, Callbacks, and Message Maps](../../mfc/reference/structures-styles-callbacks-and-message-maps.md)   \n [CPaintDC::m_ps](../../mfc/reference/cpaintdc-class.md#cpaintdc__m_ps)\n\n"}
