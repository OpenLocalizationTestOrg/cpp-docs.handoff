summarized in this list. In particular, the remaining sections explain how to declare the following:  \n  \n|Type of Variable|Description|  \n|----------------------|-----------------|  \n|[Simple variables](../c-language/simple-variable-declarations.md)|Single-value variables with integral or floating-point type|  \n|[Arrays](../c-language/array-declarations.md)|Variables composed of a collection of elements with the same type|  \n|[Pointers](../c-language/pointer-declarations.md)|Variables that point to other variables and contain variable locations (in the form of addresses) instead of values|  \n|[Enumeration variables](../c-language/c-enumeration-declarations.md)|Simple variables with integral type that hold one value from a set of named integer constants|  \n|[Structures](../c-language/structure-declarations.md)|Variables composed of a collection of values that can have different types|  \n|[Unions](../c-language/union-declarations.md)|Variables composed of several values of different types that occupy the same storage space|  \n  \n A declarator is the part of a declaration that specifies the name that is to be introduced into the program. It can include modifiers such as **\\*** (pointer-to) and any of the Microsoft calling-convention keywords.  \n  \n **Microsoft Specific**  \n  \n In the declarator  \n  \n```  \n__declspec(thread) char *var;  \n```  \n  \n `char` is the type specifier, `__declspec(thread)` and `*` are the modifiers, and `var` is the identifier's name.  \n  \n **END Microsoft Specific**  \n  \n You use declarators to declare arrays of values, pointers to values, and functions returning values of a specified type. Declarators appear in the array and pointer declarations described later in this section.  \n  \n## Syntax  \n `declarator`:  \n *pointer* opt*direct-declarator*  \n  \n *direct-declarator*:  \n *identifier*  \n  \n **(**  *declarator*  **)**  \n  \n *direct-declarator*  **[**  *constant-expression* opt**]**  \n  \n *direct-declarator*  **(**  *parameter-type-list*  **)**  \n  \n *direct-declarator*  **(**  *identifier-list* opt**)**  \n  \n `pointer`:  \n **\\*** *type-qualifier-list* opt  \n  \n **\\*** *type-qualifier-list* opt`pointer`  \n  \n *type-qualifier-list*:  \n *type-qualifier*  \n  \n *type-qualifier-list type-qualifier*  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  See the syntax for `declaration` in [Overview of Declarations](../c-language/overview-of-declarations.md) or [C Language Syntax Summary](../c-language/c-language-syntax-summary.md) for the syntax that references a `declarator`.  \n  \n When a declarator consists of an unmodified identifier, the item being declared has a base type. If an asterisk (**\\***) appears to the left of an identifier, the type is modified to a pointer type. If the identifier is followed by brackets (**[ ]**), the type is modified to an array type. If the identifier is followed by parentheses, the type is modified to a function type. For more information about interpreting precedence within declarations, see [Interpreting More Complex Declarators](../c-language/interpreting-more-complex-declarators.md).  \n  \n Each declarator declares at least one identifier. A declarator must include a type specifier to be a complete declaration. The type specifier gives the type of the elements of an array type, the type of object addressed by a pointer type, or the return type of a function.  \n  \n [Array](../c-language/array-declarations.md) and [pointer](../c-language/pointer-declarations.md) declarations are discussed in more detail later in this section. The following examples illustrate a few simple forms of declarators:  \n  \n```  \nint list[20]; // Declares an array of 20 int values named list  \nchar *cp;     // Declares a pointer to a char value  \ndouble func( void ); // Declares a function named func, with no   \n                     // arguments, that returns a double value  \nint *aptr[10] // Declares an array of 10 pointers  \n```  \n  \n **Microsoft Specific**  \n  \n The Microsoft C compiler does not limit the number of declarators that can modify an arithmetic, structure, or union type. The number is limited only by available memory.  \n  \n **END Microsoft Specific**  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Declarations and Types](../c-language/declarations-and-types.md)"}
