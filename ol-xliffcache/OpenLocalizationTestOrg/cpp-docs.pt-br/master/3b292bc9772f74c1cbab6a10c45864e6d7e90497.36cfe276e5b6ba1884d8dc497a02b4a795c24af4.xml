On input, this string is used to determine the printer to display initially in the dialog box.  \n  \n *wDeviceOffset*  \n (Input/Output) Specifies the offset in characters to the null-terminated string (maximum of 32 bytes including the null) that contains the name of the device. This string must be identical to the **dmDeviceName** member of the [DEVMODE](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd183565) structure.  \n  \n *wOutputOffset*  \n (Input/Output) Specifies the offset in characters to the null-terminated string that contains the DOS device name for the physical output medium (output port).  \n  \n *wDefault*  \n Specifies whether the strings contained in the `DEVNAMES` structure identify the default printer. This string is used to verify that the default printer has not changed since the last print operation. On input, if the **DN_DEFAULTPRN** flag is set, the other values in the `DEVNAMES` structure are checked against the current default printer. If any of the strings do not match, a warning message is displayed informing the user that the document may need to be reformatted. On output, the **wDefault** member is changed only if the Print Setup dialog box was displayed and the user chose the OK button. The **DN_DEFAULTPRN** flag is set if the default printer was selected. If a specific printer is selected, the flag is not set. All other bits in this member are reserved for internal use by the Print Dialog box procedure.  \n  \n## Remarks  \n The **PrintDlg** function uses these strings to initialize members in the system-defined Print dialog box. When the user closes the dialog box, information about the selected printer is returned in this structure.  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Header:** commdlg.h  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Structures, Styles, Callbacks, and Message Maps](../../mfc/reference/structures-styles-callbacks-and-message-maps.md)   \n [CPrintDialog::CreatePrinterDC](../../mfc/reference/cprintdialog-class.md#cprintdialog__createprinterdc)\n\n\n"}
