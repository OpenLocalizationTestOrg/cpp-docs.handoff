Instead, you must enter the statement block through normal flow of control. You can jump out of a `__try` statement block and nest exception handlers as you choose.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Writing an Exception Handler](../cpp/writing-an-exception-handler.md)   \n [Structured Exception Handling (C/C++)](../cpp/structured-exception-handling-c-cpp.md)"}
