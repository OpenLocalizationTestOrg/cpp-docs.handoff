Using ActiveX, you can:  \n  \n-   Create compound documents, which allow users to create and edit documents containing data created by multiple applications, including text, graphics, spreadsheets, sound, or other types of data.  \n  \n-   Create OLE objects that can be embedded in compound documents.  \n  \n-   Use OLE drag and drop to copy data between applications.  \n  \n-   Use Automation to control one program with another.  \n  \n-   Create ActiveX controls and ActiveX control containers (formerly called OLE controls and OLE control containers, respectively).  \n  \n The following categories of classes support ActiveX:  \n  \n-   [OLE Container Classes](../mfc/ole-container-classes.md)  \n  \n-   [OLE Server Classes](../mfc/ole-server-classes.md)  \n  \n-   [OLE Drag-and-Drop and Data Transfer Classes](../mfc/ole-drag-and-drop-and-data-transfer-classes.md)  \n  \n-   [OLE Common Dialog Classes](../mfc/ole-common-dialog-classes.md)  \n  \n-   [OLE Automation Classes](../mfc/ole-automation-classes.md)  \n  \n-   [OLE Control Classes](../mfc/ole-control-classes.md)  \n  \n-   [Active Document Classes](../mfc/active-document-classes.md)  \n  \n-   [OLE-Related Classes](../mfc/ole-related-classes.md)  \n  \n To see the inheritance of a class, use the [Class Hierarchy Chart](../mfc/hierarchy-chart.md).  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Class Overview](../mfc/class-library-overview.md)\n\n"}
