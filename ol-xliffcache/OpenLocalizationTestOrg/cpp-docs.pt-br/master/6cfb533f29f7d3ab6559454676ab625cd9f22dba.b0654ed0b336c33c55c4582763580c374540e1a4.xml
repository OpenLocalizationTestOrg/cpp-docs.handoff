CAdapt Class\nThis template is used to wrap classes that redefine the address-of operator to return something other than the address of the object.  \n  \n## Syntax  \n  \n```\ntemplate <class T>

\n|[CAdapt::m_T](#cadapt__m_t)|The data being adapted.|  \n  \n## Remarks  \n `CAdapt` is a simple template used to wrap classes that redefine the address-of operator ( `operator &`) to return something other than the address of the object. Examples of such classes include ATL's `CComBSTR`, `CComPtr`, and `CComQIPtr` classes, and the compiler COM support class, `_com_ptr_t`. These classes all redefine the address-of operator to return the address of one of their data members (a `BSTR` in the case of `CComBSTR`, and an interface pointer in the case of the other classes).  \n  \n `CAdapt`'s primary role is to hide the address-of operator defined by class `T`, yet still retain the characteristics of the adapted class. `CAdapt` fulfils this role by holding a public member, [m_T](#cadapt__m_t), of type `T`, and by defining conversion operators, comparison operators, and a copy constructor to allow specializations of `CAdapt` to be treated as if they are objects of type `T`.  \n  \n The adapter class `CAdapt` is useful because some container-style classes expect to be able to obtain the addresses of their contained objects using the address-of operator. The redefinition of the address-of operator can confound this requirement, typically causing compilation errors and preventing the use of the non-adapted type with classes that expect it to \"just work\". `CAdapt` provides a way around those problems.  \n  \n Typically, you will use `CAdapt` when you want to store `CComBSTR`, `CComPtr`, `CComQIPtr`, or `_com_ptr_t` objects in a container-style class. This was most commonly necessary for C++ Standard Library containers prior to support for the C++11 Standard, but C++11 Standard Library containers automatically work with types that have overloaded `operator&()`. The Standard Library achieves this by internally using [std::addressof()](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/6243ddc8-486a-4961-8b0c-33e9dc2e0648) to get the true addresses of objects.  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Header:** atlcomcli.h  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cadapt__cadapt\"></a>  CAdapt::CAdapt  \n The constructors allow an adapter object to be default constructed, copied from an object of the adapted type, or copied from another adapter object.  \n  \n```\nCAdapt();\nCAdapt(const T& rSrc);\n\n    CAdapt(const CAdapt& rSrCA);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `rSrc`  \n A variable of the type being adapted to be copied into the newly constructed adapter object.  \n  \n *rSrCA*  \n An adapter object whose contained data should be copied into the newly constructed adapter object.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cadapt__m_t\"></a>  CAdapt::m_T  \n Holds the data being adapted.  \n  \n```\nT m_T;\n```  \n  \n### Remarks  \n This **public** data member can be accessed directly or indirectly with [operator const T&](#cadapt__operator_const_t_amp) and [operator T&](#cadapt__operator_t_amp).  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cadapt__operator_const_t_amp\"></a>  CAdapt::operator const T&amp;  \n Returns a **const** reference to the [m_T](#cadapt__m_t) member, allowing the adapter object to be treated as if it were an object of type `T`.  \n  \n```operator const T&() const;\n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n A **const** reference to `m_T`.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cadapt__operator_t_amp\"></a>  CAdapt::operator T&amp;  \n Returns a reference to the [m_T](#cadapt__m_t) member, allowing the adapter object to be treated as if it were an object of type `T`.  \n  \n```operator T&();\n```     \n  \n### Return Value  \n A reference to `m_T`.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cadapt__operator_lt\"></a>  CAdapt::operator &lt;  \n Compares an object of the adapted type with [m_T](#cadapt__m_t).  \n  \n```\nbool operator<(const T& rSrc) const;\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `rSrc`  \n A reference to the object to be compared.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n The result of the comparison between `m_T` and `rSrc`.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cadapt__operator_eq\"></a>  CAdapt::operator =  \n The assignment operator assigns the argument, `rSrc`, to the data member [m_T](#cadapt__m_t) and returns the current adapter object.  \n  \n```\nCAdapt& operator= (const T& rSrc);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `rSrc`  \n A reference to an object of the adapted type to be copied.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n A reference to the current object.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cadapt__operator_eq_eq\"></a>  CAdapt::operator ==  \n Compares an object of the adapted type with [m_T](#cadapt__m_t).  \n  \n```\nbool operator== (const T& rSrc) const;\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `rSrc`  \n A reference to the object to be compared.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n The result of the comparison between `m_T` and `rSrc`.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Class Overview](../../atl/atl-class-overview.md)\n"}
