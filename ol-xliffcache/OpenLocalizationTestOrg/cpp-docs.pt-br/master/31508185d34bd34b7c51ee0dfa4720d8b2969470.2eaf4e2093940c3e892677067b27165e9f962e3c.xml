For example:  \n  \n```  \n// C4584.cpp  \n// compile with: /W1 /LD  \nclass A {  \n};  \n  \nclass B : public A {  \n};  \n  \nclass C : public A, public B { // C4584  \n};  \n```  \n  \n In this case, a warning would be issued on class C because it inherits both from class A and class B, which also inherits from class A. This warning serves as a reminder that you must fully qualify the use of members from these base classes or a compiler error will be generated due to the ambiguity as to which class member you refer."}
