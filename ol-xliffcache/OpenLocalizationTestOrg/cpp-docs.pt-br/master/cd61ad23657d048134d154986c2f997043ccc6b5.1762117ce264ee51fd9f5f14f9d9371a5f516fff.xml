The dialog object's destructor is called when the object goes out of scope.  \n  \n Modeless dialog boxes are normally created and owned by a parent view or frame window — the application's main frame window or a document frame window. The default [OnClose](../mfc/reference/cwnd-class.md#cwnd__onclose) handler calls [DestroyWindow](../mfc/reference/cwnd-class.md#cwnd__destroywindow), which destroys the dialog-box window. If the dialog box stands alone, with no pointers to it or other special ownership semantics, you should override [PostNcDestroy](../mfc/reference/cwnd-class.md#cwnd__postncdestroy) to destroy the C++ dialog object. You should also override [OnCancel](../mfc/reference/cdialog-class.md#cdialog__oncancel) and call `DestroyWindow` from within it. If not, the owner of the dialog box should destroy the C++ object when it is no longer necessary.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Life Cycle of a Dialog Box](../mfc/life-cycle-of-a-dialog-box.md)\n\n"}
