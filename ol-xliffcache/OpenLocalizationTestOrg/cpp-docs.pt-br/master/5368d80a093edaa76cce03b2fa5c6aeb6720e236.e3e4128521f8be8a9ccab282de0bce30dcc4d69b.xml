However, you might have menu resources that are added to the application's menu bar while the program is running.  \n  \n### To view a menu resource as a pop-up menu  \n  \n1.  Right-click the menu and choose **View as Popup** from the shortcut menu.  \n  \n     This is only a viewing preference and will not modify your menu.  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  To change back to the menu-bar view, click **View as Popup** again (which removes the check mark and returns your menu-bar view).  \n  \n For information on adding resources to managed projects, please see [Resources in Applications](http://msdn.microsoft.com/Library/8ad495d4-2941-40cf-bf64-e82e85825890) in the *.NET Framework Developer's Guide.* For information on manually adding resource files to managed projects, accessing resources, displaying static resources, and assigning resources strings to properties, see [Walkthrough: Using Resources for Localization with ASP.NET](http://msdn.microsoft.com/Library/bb4e5b44-e2b0-48ab-bbe9-609fb33900b6).  \n  \n **Requirements**  \n  \n Win32  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Creating Pop-up Menus](../windows/creating-pop-up-menus.md)   \n [Menu Editor](../mfc/menu-editor.md)   \n"}
