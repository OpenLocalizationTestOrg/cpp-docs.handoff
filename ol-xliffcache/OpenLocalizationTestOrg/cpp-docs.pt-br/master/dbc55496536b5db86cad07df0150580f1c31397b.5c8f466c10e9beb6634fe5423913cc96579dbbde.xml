Functions are usually exported from a non-MFC DLL using the standard C interface.  \n  \n For more information about non-MFC DLLs, see [Dynamic-Link Libraries](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms682589) in the [!INCLUDE[winsdkshort](../atl-mfc-shared/reference/includes/winsdkshort_md.md)].  \n  \n## What do you want to do?  \n  \n-   [Walkthrough: Creating and Using a Dynamic Link Library](../build/walkthrough-creating-and-using-a-dynamic-link-library-cpp.md)  \n  \n-   [Export from a DLL](../build/exporting-from-a-dll.md)  \n  \n-   [Link an executable to a DLL](../build/linking-an-executable-to-a-dll.md)  \n  \n-   [Initialize a DLL](../build/initializing-a-dll.md)  \n  \n## What do you want to know more about?  \n  \n-   [Regular DLLs statically linked to MFC](../build/regular-dlls-statically-linked-to-mfc.md)  \n  \n-   [Regular DLLs dynamically linked to MFC](../build/regular-dlls-dynamically-linked-to-mfc.md)  \n  \n-   [Extension DLLs: Overview](../build/extension-dlls-overview.md)  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Kinds of DLLs](../build/kinds-of-dlls.md)"}
