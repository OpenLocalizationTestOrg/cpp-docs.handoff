# Expression Evaluator Error CXX0020
operand types bad for this operation  
  
 An operator was applied to an expression with an invalid type for that operator.  
  
 For example, it is not valid to take the address of a register or subscript an array with a floating-point expression.  
  
 This error is identical to CAN0020.
