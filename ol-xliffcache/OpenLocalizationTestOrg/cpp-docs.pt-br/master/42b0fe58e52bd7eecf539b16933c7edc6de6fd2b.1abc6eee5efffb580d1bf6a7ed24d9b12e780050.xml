These utility classes can now be used in any native C++ project. This section only includes classes that were previously available to MFC projects and have now been shared, plus a few new classes related to the changes in `CString`. It does not include the ATL classes, which can be used in any native C++ project type by inclusion of the appropriate header.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Classes Shared Between MFC and ATL](../atl-mfc-shared/reference/classes-shared-by-mfc-and-atl.md)  \n Provides links to the classes shared between MFC and ATL.  \n  \n## Related Sections  \n [Active Template Library (ATL) Reference](../atl/atl-com-desktop-components.md)  \n Provides reference material for the ATL Library, a set of template-based C++ classes that simplify the programming of COM objects.  \n  \n [Microsoft Foundation Class Library (MFC) Reference](../mfc/mfc-desktop-applications.md)  \n Provides reference material for the MFC Library, a set of classes in that constitute an application framework, which is the framework of an application written for the Windows API.  \n  \n [NIB: Samples Included in Visual C++](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/c9ec56b3-2bbd-49b4-8a4c-9ed4b78b7a84)  \n Provides links to sample code showing the capabilities of Visual C++ and the libraries and technologies it supports.  \n  \n [Visual C++ Libraries](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/fec23c40-10c0-4857-9cdc-33a3b99b30ae)  \n Provides links to the various libraries provided with Visual C++, including ATL, MFC, OLE DB Templates, the C run-time library, and the Standard C++ Library.  \n  \n [Debugging](/visualstudio/debugger/debugging-in-visual-studio)  \n Provides links to using the Visual Studio debugger to correct logic errors in your application or stored procedures.\n\n"}
