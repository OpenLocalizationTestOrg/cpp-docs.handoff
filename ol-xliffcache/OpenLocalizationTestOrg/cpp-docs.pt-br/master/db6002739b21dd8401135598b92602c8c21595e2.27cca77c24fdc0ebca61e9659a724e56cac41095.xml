memory files.  \n  \n## Syntax  \n  \n```  \nclass CSharedFile : public CMemFile  \n```  \n  \n## Members  \n  \n### Public Constructors  \n  \n|Name|Description|  \n|----------|-----------------|  \n|[CSharedFile::CSharedFile](#csharedfile__csharedfile)|Constructs a `CSharedFile` object.|  \n  \n### Public Methods  \n  \n|Name|Description|  \n|----------|-----------------|  \n|[CSharedFile::Detach](#csharedfile__detach)|Closes the shared memory file and returns the handle of its memory block.|  \n|[CSharedFile::SetHandle](#csharedfile__sethandle)|Attaches the shared memory file to a memory block.|  \n  \n## Remarks  \n Memory files behave like disk files except that the file is stored in RAM rather than on disk. A memory file is useful for fast temporary storage or for transferring raw bytes or serialized objects between independent processes.  \n  \n Shared memory files differ from other memory files in that memory for them is allocated with the [GlobalAlloc](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa366574) Windows function. The `CSharedFile` class stores data in a globally allocated memory block (created using **GlobalAlloc**), and this memory block can be shared using DDE, the Clipboard, or other OLE/COM uniform data transfer operations, for example, using `IDataObject`.  \n  \n **GlobalAlloc** returns an `HGLOBAL` handle rather than a pointer to memory, such as the pointer returned by [malloc](../../c-runtime-library/reference/malloc.md). The `HGLOBAL` handle is needed in certain applications. For example, to put data on the Clipboard you need an `HGLOBAL` handle.  \n  \n Please note that `CSharedFile` does not use memory-mapped files, and the data cannot be directly shared between processes.  \n  \n `CSharedFile` objects can automatically allocate their own memory or you can attach your own memory block to the `CSharedFile` object by calling [CSharedFile::SetHandle](#csharedfile__sethandle). In either case, memory for growing the memory file automatically is allocated in `nGrowBytes`-sized increments if `nGrowBytes` is not zero.  \n  \n For more information, see the article [Files in MFC](../../mfc/files-in-mfc.md) and [File Handling](../../c-runtime-library/file-handling.md) in the *Run-Time Library Reference*.  \n  \n## Inheritance Hierarchy  \n [CObject](../../mfc/reference/cobject-class.md)  \n  \n [CFile](../../mfc/reference/cfile-class.md)  \n  \n [CMemFile](../../mfc/reference/cmemfile-class.md)  \n  \n `CSharedFile`  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Header:** afxadv.h  \n  \n##  <a name=\"csharedfile__csharedfile\"></a>  CSharedFile::CSharedFile  \n Constructs a `CSharedFile` object and allocates memory for it.  \n  \n```  \nCSharedFile(\n    UINT nAllocFlags = GMEM_DDESHARE | GMEM_MOVEABLE,  \n    UINT nGrowBytes = 4096);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n *nAllocFlags*  \n Flags indicating how memory is to be allocated.
