More secure versions of these functions are available; see [_cgets_s, _cgetws_s](../c-runtime-library/reference/cgets-s-cgetws-s.md).  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  These functions are obsolete. Beginning in Visual Studio 2015, they are not available in the CRT. The secure versions of these functions,  _cgets_s and _cgetws_s, are still available. For information on these alternative functions, see [_cgets_s, _cgetws_s](../c-runtime-library/reference/cgets-s-cgetws-s.md).  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  This API cannot be used in applications that execute in the Windows Runtime. For more information, see [CRT functions not supported with /ZW](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/jj606124.aspx).  \n  \n## Syntax  \n  \n```  \nchar *_cgets(   \n   char *buffer   \n);  \nwchar_t *_cgetws(  \n   wchar_t *buffer  \n);  \ntemplate <size_t size>  \nchar *_cgets(   \n   char (&buffer)[size]  \n); // C++ only  \ntemplate <size_t size>  \nwchar_t *_cgetws(  \n   wchar_t (&buffer)[size]  \n); // C++ only  \n```  \n  \n#### Parameters  \n `buffer`  \n Storage location for data.  \n  \n## Return Value  \n `_cgets` and `_cgetws` return a pointer to the start of the string, at `buffer[2]`. If `buffer` is `NULL`, these functions invoke the invalid parameter handler, as described in [Parameter Validation](../c-runtime-library/parameter-validation.md). If execution is allowed to continue, they return `NULL` and set `errno` to `EINVAL`.  \n  \n## Remarks  \n These functions read a string of characters from the console and store the string and its length in the location pointed to by `buffer`. The `buffer` parameter must be a pointer to a character array. The first element of the array, `buffer[0]`, must contain the maximum length (in characters) of the string to be read. The array must contain enough elements to hold the string, a terminating null character ('\\0'), and 2 additional bytes. The function reads characters until a carriage return–line feed (CR-LF) combination or the specified number of characters is read. The string is stored starting at `buffer[2]`. If the function reads a CR-LF, it stores the null character ('\\0'). The function then stores the actual length of the string in the second array element, `buffer[1]`.  \n  \n Because all editing keys are active when `_cgets` or`_cgetws` is called while in a console window, pressing the F3 key repeats the last entered entry.  \n  \n In C++, these functions have template overloads that invoke the newer, secure counterparts of these functions.
