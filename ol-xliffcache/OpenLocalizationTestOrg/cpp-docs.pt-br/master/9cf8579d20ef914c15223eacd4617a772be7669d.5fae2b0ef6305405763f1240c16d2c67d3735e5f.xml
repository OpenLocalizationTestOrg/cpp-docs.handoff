An ATL DHTML control:  \n  \n-   Hosts the WebBrowser control.  \n  \n-   Specifies, using HTML, the user interface (UI) of the DHTML control.  \n  \n-   Accesses the WebBrowser object and its methods through its interface, [IWebBrowser2](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa752127.aspx).  \n  \n-   Manages communication between C++ code and HTML.  \n  \n A DHTML control is similar to any other ATL control, except the DHTML control includes an additional dispatch interface. See the figure in [Identifying the Elements of the DHTML Control Project](../atl/identifying-the-elements-of-the-dhtml-control-project.md) for an illustration of the interfaces provided in the default DHTML project.  \n  \n You can view the ATL DHTML control in a Web browser or other container, such as the ActiveX Control Test Container.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Identifying the Elements of the DHTML Control Project](../atl/identifying-the-elements-of-the-dhtml-control-project.md)  \n Describes the elements of a DHTML control project.  \n  \n [Calling C++ Code from DHTML](../atl/calling-cpp-code-from-dhtml.md)  \n Provides an example of calling C++ code from a DHTML control.  \n  \n [Creating an ATL DHTML Control](../atl/creating-an-atl-dhtml-control.md)  \n Lists the steps for creating a DHTML control.  \n  \n [Testing the ATL DHTML Control](../atl/testing-the-atl-dhtml-control.md)  \n Shows how to build and test the initial DHTML control project.  \n  \n [Modifying the ATL DHTML Control](../atl/modifying-the-atl-dhtml-control.md)  \n Shows how to add some functionality to the control.  \n  \n [Testing the Altered ATL DHTML Control](../atl/testing-the-modified-atl-dhtml-control.md)  \n Shows how to build and test the control's added functionality.  \n  \n## Related Sections  \n [ATL](../atl/active-template-library-atl-concepts.md)  \n Provides links to conceptual topics on how to program using the Active Template Library.\n\n"}
