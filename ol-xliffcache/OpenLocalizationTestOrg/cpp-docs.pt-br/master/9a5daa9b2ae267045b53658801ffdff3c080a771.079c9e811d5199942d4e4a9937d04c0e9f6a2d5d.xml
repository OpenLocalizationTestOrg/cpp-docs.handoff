The text can be assigned character and paragraph formatting, and can include embedded OLE objects. Rich edit controls provide a programming interface for formatting text. However, an application must implement any user interface components necessary to make formatting operations available to the user.  \n  \n This Windows Common control (and therefore the `CRichEditCtrl` class) is available only to programs running under Windows 95/98 and Windows NT versions 3.51 and later. The `CRichEditCtrl` class supports versions 2.0 and 3.0 of the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../../atl/includes/winsdk_md.md)] rich edit control.  \n  \n> [!CAUTION]\n>  If you are using a rich edit control in a dialog box (regardless whether your application is SDI, MDI, or dialog-based), you must call [AfxInitRichEdit](application-information-and-management.md#afxinitrichedit) once before the dialog box is displayed. A typical place to call this function is in your program's `InitInstance` member function. You do not need to call it for each time you display the dialog box, only the first time. You do not have to call `AfxInitRichEdit` if you are working with `CRichEditView`.  \n  \n For more information on using `CRichEditCtrl`, see:  \n  \n- [Controls](../../mfc/controls-mfc.md)  \n  \n- [Using CRichEditCtrl](../../mfc/using-cricheditctrl.md)  \n  \n-   Knowledge Base article Q259949 : INFO: SetCaretPos() Is Not Appropriate with CEdit or CRichEditCtrl Controls  \n  \n For an example of using a rich edit control in an MFC application, see the [WORDPAD](../../visual-cpp-samples.md) sample application.  \n  \n## Inheritance Hierarchy  \n [CObject](../../mfc/reference/cobject-class.md)  \n  \n [CCmdTarget](../../mfc/reference/ccmdtarget-class.md)  \n  \n [CWnd](../../mfc/reference/cwnd-class.md)  \n  \n `CRichEditCtrl`  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Header:** afxcmn.h  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cricheditctrl__canpaste\"></a>  CRichEditCtrl::CanPaste  \n Determines if the rich edit control can paste the specified Clipboard format.  \n  \n```  \nBOOL CanPaste(UINT nFormat = 0) const;\n\n \n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `nFormat`  \n The Clipboard data format to query. This parameter can be one of the predefined Clipboard formats or the value returned by [RegisterClipboardFormat](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms649049).  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Nonzero if the Clipboard format can be pasted; otherwise 0.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n If `nFormat` is 0, `CanPaste` will try any format currently on the Clipboard.  \n  \n For more information, see [EM_CANPASTE](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb787993) message and [RegisterClipboardFormat](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms649049) function in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../../atl/includes/winsdk_md.md)].  \n  \n### Example  \n [!code-cpp[NVC_MFC_CRichEditCtrl#1](../../mfc/reference/codesnippet/cpp/cricheditctrl-class_1.cpp)]  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cricheditctrl__canredo\"></a>  CRichEditCtrl::CanRedo  \n Determines if the redo queue contains any actions.  \n  \n```  \nBOOL CanRedo() const;\n\n \n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Nonzero if the redo queue contains actions, otherwise 0.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n To discover the name of the operation in the redo queue, call [CRichEditCtrl::GetRedoName](#cricheditctrl__getredoname). To redo the most recent Undo operation, call [Redo](#cricheditctrl__redo).  \n  \n For more information, see [EM_CANREDO](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb787995) in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../../atl/includes/winsdk_md.md)].  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cricheditctrl__canundo\"></a>  CRichEditCtrl::CanUndo  \n Determines if the last editing operation can be undone.  \n  \n```  \nBOOL CanUndo() const;\n\n \n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Nonzero if the last edit operation can be undone by a call to the [Undo](#cricheditctrl__undo) member function; 0 if it cannot be undone.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n For more information, see [EM_CANUNDO](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb775468) in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../../atl/includes/winsdk_md.md)].  \n  \n### Example  \n [!code-cpp[NVC_MFC_CRichEditCtrl#2](../../mfc/reference/codesnippet/cpp/cricheditctrl-class_2.cpp)]  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cricheditctrl__charfrompos\"></a>  CRichEditCtrl::CharFromPos  \n Retrieves information about the character at the point specified by the parameter `pt`.  \n  \n```  \nint CharFromPos(CPoint pt) const;\n\n \n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `pt`  \n A [CPoint](../../atl-mfc-shared/reference/cpoint-class.md) object containing the coordinates of the specified point.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n The zero-based character index of the character nearest the specified point. If the specified point is beyond the last character in the control, the return value indicates the last character in the control.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n This member function works with a rich edit control. To get the information for an edit control, call [CEdit::CharFromPos](../../mfc/reference/cedit-class.md#cedit__charfrompos).  \n  \n For more information, see [EM_CHARFROMPOS](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb761566) in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../../atl/includes/winsdk_md.md)].  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cricheditctrl__clear\"></a>  CRichEditCtrl::Clear  \n Deletes (clears) the current selection (if any) in the rich edit control.  \n  \n```  \nvoid Clear();\n```  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The deletion performed by **Clear** can be undone by calling the [Undo](#cricheditctrl__undo) member function.  \n  \n To delete the current selection and place the deleted contents onto the Clipboard, call the [Cut](#cricheditctrl__cut) member function.  \n  \n For more information, see [WM_CLEAR](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms649020) in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../../atl/includes/winsdk_md.md)].  \n  \n### Example  \n [!code-cpp[NVC_MFC_CRichEditCtrl#3](../../mfc/reference/codesnippet/cpp/cricheditctrl-class_3.cpp)]  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cricheditctrl__copy\"></a>  CRichEditCtrl::Copy  \n Copies the current selection (if any) in the rich edit control to the Clipboard.  \n  \n```  \nvoid Copy();\n```  \n  \n### Remarks  \n For more information, see [WM_COPY](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms649022) in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../../atl/includes/winsdk_md.md)].  \n  \n### Example  \n [!code-cpp[NVC_MFC_CRichEditCtrl#4](../../mfc/reference/codesnippet/cpp/cricheditctrl-class_4.cpp)]  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cricheditctrl__create\"></a>  CRichEditCtrl::Create  \n Creates the Windows rich edit control and associates it with this `CRichEditCtrl` object.  \n  \n```  \nvirtual BOOL Create(\n    DWORD dwStyle,  \n    const RECT& rect,  \n    CWnd* pParentWnd,  \n    UINT nID);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `dwStyle`  \n Specifies the edit control's style. Apply a combination of the window styles listed in the **Remarks** section below, and [edit control styles](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb775464), described in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../../atl/includes/winsdk_md.md)].  \n  \n `rect`  \n Specifies the edit control's size and position. Can be a [CRect](../../atl-mfc-shared/reference/crect-class.md) object or [RECT](../../mfc/reference/rect-structure1.md) structure.  \n  \n `pParentWnd`  \n Specifies the edit control's parent window (often a [CDialog](../../mfc/reference/cdialog-class.md)). It must not be **NULL**.  \n  \n `nID`  \n Specifies the edit control's ID.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Nonzero if initialization is successful; otherwise, 0.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n You construct a `CRichEditCtrl` object in two steps. First, call the [CRichEditCtrl](#cricheditctrl__cricheditctrl) constructor, then call **Create**, which creates the Windows edit control and attaches it to the `CRichEditCtrl` object.  \n  \n When you create a rich edit control with this function, first you must load the necessary common controls library. To load the libary, call the global function [AfxInitRichEdit](application-information-and-management.md#afxinitrichedit), which in turn initializes the common controls library. You need to call `AfxInitRichEdit` only once in your process.  \n  \n When **Create** executes, Windows sends the [WM_NCCREATE](../../mfc/reference/cwnd-class.md#cwnd__onnccreate), [WM_NCCALCSIZE](../../mfc/reference/cwnd-class.md#cwnd__onnccalcsize), [WM_CREATE](../../mfc/reference/cwnd-class.md#cwnd__oncreate), and [WM_GETMINMAXINFO](../../mfc/reference/cwnd-class.md#cwnd__ongetminmaxinfo) messages to the edit control.  \n  \n These messages are handled by default by the [OnNcCreate](../../mfc/reference/cwnd-class.md#cwnd__onnccreate), [OnNcCalcSize](../../mfc/reference/cwnd-class.md#cwnd__onnccalcsize), [OnCreate](../../mfc/reference/cwnd-class.md#cwnd__oncreate), and [OnGetMinMaxInfo](../../mfc/reference/cwnd-class.md#cwnd__ongetminmaxinfo) member functions in the `CWnd` base class. To extend the default message handling, derive a class from `CRichEditCtrl`, add a message map to the new class, and override the above message-handler member functions. Override `OnCreate`, for example, to perform needed initialization for the new class.  \n  \n Apply the following [window styles](../../mfc/reference/window-styles.md) to an edit control.  \n  \n- **WS_CHILD** Always.  \n  \n- **WS_VISIBLE** Usually.  \n  \n- **WS_DISABLED** Rarely.  \n  \n- **WS_GROUP** To group controls.  \n  \n- **WS_TABSTOP** To include edit control in the tabbing order.  \n  \n For more information about window styles, see [CreateWindow](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms632679) in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../../atl/includes/winsdk_md.md)].  \n  \n### Example  \n [!code-cpp[NVC_MFC_CRichEditCtrl#5](../../mfc/reference/codesnippet/cpp/cricheditctrl-class_5.cpp)]  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cricheditctrl__createex\"></a>  CRichEditCtrl::CreateEx  \n Creates a control (a child window) and associates it with the `CRichEditCtrl` object.  \n  \n```  \nvirtual BOOL CreateEx(\n    DWORD dwExStyle,  \n    DWORD dwStyle,  \n    const RECT& rect,  \n    CWnd* pParentWnd,  \n    UINT nID);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `dwExStyle`  \n Specifies the extended style of the control being created. For a list of extended Windows styles, see the `dwExStyle` parameter for [CreateWindowEx](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms632680) in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../../atl/includes/winsdk_md.md)].  \n  \n `dwStyle`  \n Specifies the edit control's style. Apply a combination of the window styles listed in the **Remarks** section of [Create](#cricheditctrl__create) and [edit control styles](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb775464), described in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../../atl/includes/winsdk_md.md)].  \n  \n `rect`  \n A reference to a [RECT](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd162897) structure describing the size and position of the window to be created, in client coordinates of `pParentWnd`.  \n  \n `pParentWnd`  \n A pointer to the window that is the control's parent.  \n  \n `nID`  \n The control's child-window ID.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Nonzero if successful; otherwise 0.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n Use `CreateEx` instead of **Create** to apply extended Windows styles, specified by the Windows extended style preface **WS_EX_**.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cricheditctrl__cricheditctrl\"></a>  CRichEditCtrl::CRichEditCtrl  \n Constructs a `CRichEditCtrl` object.  \n  \n```  \nCRichEditCtrl();\n```  \n  \n### Remarks  \n Use [Create](#cricheditctrl__create) to construct the Windows rich edit control.  \n  \n### Example  \n [!code-cpp[NVC_MFC_CRichEditCtrl#6](../../mfc/reference/codesnippet/cpp/cricheditctrl-class_6.cpp)]  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cricheditctrl__cut\"></a>  CRichEditCtrl::Cut  \n Delete (cuts) the current selection (if any) in the rich edit control and copies the deleted text to the Clipboard.  \n  \n```  \nvoid Cut();\n```  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The deletion performed by **Cut** can be undone by calling the [Undo](#cricheditctrl__undo) member function.  \n  \n To delete the current selection without placing the deleted text into the Clipboard, call the [Clear](#cricheditctrl__clear) member function.  \n  \n For more information, see [WM_CUT](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms649023) in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../../atl/includes/winsdk_md.md)].  \n  \n### Example  \n [!code-cpp[NVC_MFC_CRichEditCtrl#7](../../mfc/reference/codesnippet/cpp/cricheditctrl-class_7.cpp)]  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cricheditctrl__displayband\"></a>  CRichEditCtrl::DisplayBand  \n Displays a portion of the contents of the rich edit control (text and OLE items), as previously formatted by [FormatRange](#cricheditctrl__formatrange).  \n  \n```  \nBOOL DisplayBand(LPRECT pDisplayRect);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `pDisplayRect`  \n Pointer to a [RECT](../../mfc/reference/rect-structure1.md) or [CRect](../../atl-mfc-shared/reference/crect-class.md) object specifying the area of the device to display the text.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Nonzero if the display of the formatted text succeeds, otherwise, 0.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The text and OLE items are clipped to the area specified by the pointer `pDisplayRect`.  \n  \n For more information, see [EM_DISPLAYBAND](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb787997) in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../../atl/includes/winsdk_md.md)].  \n  \n### Example  \n  See the example for [CRichEditCtrl::FormatRange](#cricheditctrl__formatrange).  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cricheditctrl__emptyundobuffer\"></a>  CRichEditCtrl::EmptyUndoBuffer  \n Resets (clear) the undo flag of this rich edit control.  \n  \n```  \nvoid EmptyUndoBuffer();\n```  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The control will now be unable to undo the last editing operation. The undo flag is set whenever an operation within the rich edit control can be undone.  \n  \n The undo flag is automatically cleared whenever you call the [CWnd](../../mfc/reference/cwnd-class.md) member function [SetWindowText](../../mfc/reference/cwnd-class.md#cwnd__setwindowtext).  \n  \n For more information, see [EM_EMPTYUNDOBUFFER](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb761568) in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../../atl/includes/winsdk_md.md)].  \n  \n### Example  \n [!code-cpp[NVC_MFC_CRichEditCtrl#8](../../mfc/reference/codesnippet/cpp/cricheditctrl-class_8.cpp)]  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cricheditctrl__findtext\"></a>  CRichEditCtrl::FindText  \n Finds text within the rich edit control.  \n  \n```  \nlong FindText(\n    DWORD dwFlags,  \n    FINDTEXTEX* pFindText) const;\n\n \n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `dwFlags`  \n For a list of possible values, see `wParam` in [EM_FINDTEXTEXT](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb788011) in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../../atl/includes/winsdk_md.md)].  \n  \n *pFindText*  \n Pointer to the [FINDTEXTEX](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb787909) structure giving the parameters for the search and returning the range where the match was found.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Zero-based character position of the next match; – 1 if there are no more matches.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n You can search either up or down by setting the proper range parameters in the [CHARRANGE](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb787885) structure within the **FINDTEXTEX** structure.  \n  \n For more information, see [EM_FINDTEXTEX](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb788011) message and [FINDTEXTEX](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb787909) structure in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../../atl/includes/winsdk_md.md)].  \n  \n### Example  \n [!code-cpp[NVC_MFC_CRichEditCtrl#9](../../mfc/reference/codesnippet/cpp/cricheditctrl-class_9.cpp)]  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cricheditctrl__findwordbreak\"></a>  CRichEditCtrl::FindWordBreak  \n Finds the next word break before or after the position specified by `nStart`.  \n  \n```  \nDWORD FindWordBreak(\n    UINT nCode,  \n    DWORD nStart) const;\n\n \n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `nCode`  \n Indicates the action to take.

When the user presses the ENTER key, the control scrolls all text back to position zero.  \n  \n- `ECO_AUTOHSCROLL` Automatically scrolls text up one page when the user presses the ENTER key on the last line.  \n  \n- `ECO_NOHIDESEL` Negates the default behavior for an edit control. The default behavior hides the selection when the control loses the input focus and shows the selection when the control receives the input focus. If you specify `ECO_NOHIDESEL`, the selected text is inverted, even if the control does not have the focus.  \n  \n- `ECO_READONLY` Prevents the user from typing or editing text in the edit control.  \n  \n- `ECO_WANTRETURN` Specifies that a carriage return be inserted when the user presses the ENTER key while entering text into a multiple-line rich edit control in a dialog box. If you do not specify this style, pressing the ENTER key sends a command to the rich edit control's parent window, which mimics clicking the parent window's default button (for example, the OK button in a dialog box). This style has no effect on a single-line edit control.  \n  \n- `ECO_SAVESEL` Preserves the selection when the control loses the focus.

For better performance, set the limit to the smallest possible value.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cricheditctrl__setwordcharformat\"></a>  CRichEditCtrl::SetWordCharFormat  \n Sets the character formatting attributes for the currently selected word in this `CRichEditCtrl` object.  \n  \n```  \nBOOL SetWordCharFormat(CHARFORMAT& cf);\n\n \nBOOL SetWordCharFormat(CHARFORMAT2& cf);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `cf`  \n In the first version, a pointer to a [CHARFORMAT](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb787881) structure containing the new character formatting attributes for the currently selected word.  \n  \n In the second version, a pointer to a [CHARFORMAT2](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb787883) structure, which is a Rich Edit 2.0 extension to the **CHARFORMAT** structure, containing the new character formatting attributes for the currently selected word.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Nonzero if successful; otherwise, 0.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n Only the attributes specified by the **dwMask** member of `cf` are changed by this function.  \n  \n For more information, see the [EM_SETCHARFORMAT](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb774230) message and the **CHARFORMAT** and **CHARFORMAT2** structures in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../../atl/includes/winsdk_md.md)].  \n  \n### Example  \n [!code-cpp[NVC_MFC_CRichEditCtrl#33](../../mfc/reference/codesnippet/cpp/cricheditctrl-class_33.cpp)]  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cricheditctrl__setwordwrapmode\"></a>  CRichEditCtrl::SetWordWrapMode  \n Sets the word-wrapping and word-breaking options for the rich edit control.  \n  \n```  \nUINT SetWordWrapMode(UINT uFlags) const;\n\n \n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `uFlags`  \n The options to set for word wrapping and word breaking. For a list of possible options, see [EM_SETWORDWRAPMODE](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb774294) in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../../atl/includes/winsdk_md.md)].  \n  \n### Return Value  \n The current word-wrapping and word-breaking options.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n This message is available only in Asian-language versions of the operating system.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cricheditctrl__stopgrouptyping\"></a>  CRichEditCtrl::StopGroupTyping  \n Stops the control from collecting additional typing actions into the current undo action.  \n  \n```  \nvoid StopGroupTyping();\n```  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The control stores the next typing action, if any, into a new action in the undo queue.  \n  \n For more information, see [EM_STOPGROUPTYPING](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb774300) in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../../atl/includes/winsdk_md.md)].  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cricheditctrl__streamin\"></a>  CRichEditCtrl::StreamIn  \n Replaces text in this `CRichEditCtrl` object with text from the specified input stream.  \n  \n```  \nlong StreamIn(\n    int nFormat,  \n    EDITSTREAM& es);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `nFormat`  \n Flags specifying the input data formats. See the Remarks section for more information.  \n  \n `es`  \n [EDITSTREAM](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb787891) structure specifying the input stream. See the Remarks section for more information.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Number of characters read from the input stream.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The value of `nFormat` must be one of the following:  \n  \n- `SF_TEXT` Indicates reading text only.  \n  \n- `SF_RTF` Indicates reading text and formatting.  \n  \n Either of these values can be combined with `SFF_SELECTION`. If `SFF_SELECTION` is specified, `StreamIn` replaces the current selection with the contents of the input stream. If it is not specified, `StreamIn` replaces the entire contents of this `CRichEditCtrl` object.  \n  \n In the **EDITSTREAM** parameter `es`, you specify a callback function that fills a buffer with text. This callback function is called repeatedly, until the input stream is exhausted.  \n  \n For more information, see [EM_STREAMIN](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb774302) message and [EDITSTREAM](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb787891) structure in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../../atl/includes/winsdk_md.md)].  \n  \n### Example  \n [!code-cpp[NVC_MFC_CRichEditCtrl#34](../../mfc/reference/codesnippet/cpp/cricheditctrl-class_34.cpp)]  \n  \n [!code-cpp[NVC_MFC_CRichEditCtrl#35](../../mfc/reference/codesnippet/cpp/cricheditctrl-class_35.cpp)]  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cricheditctrl__streamout\"></a>  CRichEditCtrl::StreamOut  \n Writes out the contents of this `CRichEditCtrl` object to the specified output stream.  \n  \n```  \nlong StreamOut(\n    int nFormat,  \n    EDITSTREAM& es);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `nFormat`  \n Flags specifying the output data formats.
