used in applications that execute in the [!INCLUDE[wrt](../../atl/reference/includes/wrt_md.md)]. For more information, see [CRT functions not supported with /ZW](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/jj606124.aspx).  \n  \n## Syntax  \n  \n```  \nintptr_t _spawnlpe(  \n   int mode,  \n   const char *cmdname,  \n   const char *arg0,  \n   const char *arg1,  \n   ... const char *argn,  \n   NULL,  \n   const char *const *envp   \n);  \nintptr_t _wspawnlpe(  \n   int mode,  \n   const wchar_t *cmdname,  \n   const wchar_t *arg0,  \n   const wchar_t *arg1,  \n   ... const wchar_t *argn,  \n   NULL,  \n   const wchar_t *const *envp   \n);  \n```  \n  \n#### Parameters  \n `mode`  \n Execution mode for the calling process.  \n  \n `cmdname`  \n Path of the file to be executed.  \n  \n `arg0, arg1, ... argn`  \n List of pointers to arguments. The `arg0` argument is typically a pointer to `cmdname`. The arguments `arg1` through `argn` are pointers to the character strings that form the new argument list. Following `argn`, there must be a `NULL` pointer to mark the end of the argument list.  \n  \n `envp`  \n Array of pointers to environment settings.  \n  \n## Return Value  \n The return value from a synchronous `_spawnlpe` or `_wspawnlpe` (`_P_WAIT` specified for `mode`) is the exit status of the new process. The return value from an asynchronous `_spawnlpe` or `_wspawnlpe` (`_P_NOWAIT` or `_P_NOWAITO` specified for `mode`) is the process handle. The exit status is 0 if the process terminated normally. You can set the exit status to a nonzero value if the spawned process specifically uses a nonzero argument to call the `exit` routine. If the new process did not explicitly set a positive exit status, a positive exit status indicates an abnormal exit caused by an abort or an interrupt. A return value of –1 indicates an error (the new process is not started). In this case, `errno` is set to one of the following values.  \n  \n `E2BIG`  \n Argument list exceeds 1024 bytes.  \n  \n `EINVAL`  \n `mode` argument is invalid.  \n  \n `ENOENT`  \n File or path is not found.  \n  \n `ENOEXEC`  \n Specified file is not executable or has an invalid executable-file format.  \n  \n `ENOMEM`  \n Not enough memory is available to execute the new process.  \n  \n For more information about these and other return codes, see [errno, _doserrno, _sys_errlist, and _sys_nerr](../../c-runtime-library/errno-doserrno-sys-errlist-and-sys-nerr.md).  \n  \n## Remarks  \n Each of these functions creates and executes a new process, passes each command-line argument as a separate parameter, and passes an array of pointers to environment settings. These functions use the `PATH` environment variable to find the file to execute.  \n  \n These functions validate their parameters. If either `cmdname` or `arg0` is an empty string or a null pointer, the invalid parameter handler is invoked, as described in [Parameter Validation](../../c-runtime-library/parameter-validation.md). If execution is allowed to continue, these functions set `errno` to `EINVAL`, and return -1. No new process is spawned.  \n  \n## Requirements  \n  \n|Routine|Required header|  \n|-------------|---------------------|  \n|`_spawnlpe`|\\<process.h>|  \n|`_wspawnlpe`|\\<stdio.h> or \\<wchar.h>|  \n  \n For more compatibility information, see [Compatibility](../../c-runtime-library/compatibility.md).  \n  \n## Example  \n See the example in [_spawn, _wspawn Functions](../../c-runtime-library/spawn-wspawn-functions.md).  \n  \n## .NET Framework Equivalent  \n  \n-   [System::Diagnostics::Process Class](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.diagnostics.process.aspx)  \n  \n-   [System::Diagnostics::ProcessStartInfo Class](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.diagnostics.processstartinfo.aspx)  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Process and Environment Control](../../c-runtime-library/process-and-environment-control.md)   \n [_spawn, _wspawn Functions](../../c-runtime-library/spawn-wspawn-functions.md)   \n [abort](../../c-runtime-library/reference/abort.md)   \n [atexit](../../c-runtime-library/reference/atexit.md)   \n [_exec, _wexec Functions](../../c-runtime-library/exec-wexec-functions.md)   \n [exit, _Exit, _exit](../../c-runtime-library/reference/exit-exit-exit.md)   \n [_flushall](../../c-runtime-library/reference/flushall.md)   \n [_getmbcp](../../c-runtime-library/reference/getmbcp.md)   \n [_onexit, _onexit_m](../../c-runtime-library/reference/onexit-onexit-m.md)   \n [_setmbcp](../../c-runtime-library/reference/setmbcp.md)   \n [system, _wsystem](../../c-runtime-library/reference/system-wsystem.md)"}
