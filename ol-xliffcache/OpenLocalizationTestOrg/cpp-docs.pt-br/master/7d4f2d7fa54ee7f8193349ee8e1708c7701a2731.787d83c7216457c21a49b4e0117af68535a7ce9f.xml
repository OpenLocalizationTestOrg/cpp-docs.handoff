Binding can allow an image to load faster when the loader doesn't have to rebase and perform address fixup for each referenced DLL. You may not want a DLL to be bound if it has been digitally signed—binding invalidates the signature. Binding has no effect if address space layout randomization (ASLR) is enabled for the image by using **/DYNAMICBASE** on versions of Windows that support ASLR.  \n  \n Use **/ALLOWBIND:NO** to prevent Bind.exe from binding the DLL.  \n  \n For more information, see the [/ALLOWBIND](../../build/reference/allowbind-prevent-dll-binding.md) linker option.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [EDITBIN Options](../../build/reference/editbin-options.md)"}
