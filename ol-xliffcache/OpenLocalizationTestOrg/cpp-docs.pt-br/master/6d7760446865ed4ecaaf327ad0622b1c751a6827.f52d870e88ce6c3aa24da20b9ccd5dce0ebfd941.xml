Normally, the linker records the location of the .pdb file in the binaries that it produces. You can use this option to provide a different path and file name for the .pdb file. The information provided with /PDBALTPATH does not change the location or name of the actual .pdb file; it changes the information that the linker writes in the binary file. This enables you to provide a path that is independent of the file structure of the build computer. Two common uses for this option are to provide a network path or a file that has no path information.  \n  \n The value of *pdb_file_name* can be an arbitrary string, an environment variable, or **%_PDB%**. The linker will expand an environment variable, such as **%SystemRoot%**, to its value. The linker defines the environment variables **%_PDB%** and **%_EXT%**. **%_PDB%** expands to the file name of the actual .pdb file without any path information and **%_EXT%** is the extension of the generated executable.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [DUMPBIN Options](../../build/reference/dumpbin-options.md)   \n [/PDBPATH](../../build/reference/pdbpath.md)"}
