CPoint Class\nSimilar to the Windows `POINT` structure.  \n  \n## Syntax  \n  \n```  \nclass CPoint : public tagPOINT  \n```  \n  \n## Members  \n  \n### Public Constructors  \n  \n|Name|Description|  \n|----------|-----------------|  \n|[CPoint::CPoint](#cpoint__cpoint)|Constructs a `CPoint`.|  \n  \n### Public Methods  \n  \n|Name|Description|  \n|----------|-----------------|  \n|[CPoint::Offset](#cpoint__offset)|Adds values to the **x** and **y** members of the `CPoint`.|  \n  \n### Public Operators  \n  \n|Name|Description|  \n|----------|-----------------|  \n|[CPoint::operator -](#cpoint__operator_-)|Returns the difference of a `CPoint` and a size, or the negation of a point, or the size difference between two points, or the offset by a negative size.|  \n|[CPoint::operator !=](#cpoint__operator__neq)|Checks for inequality between two points.|  \n|[CPoint::operator +](#cpoint__operator__add)|Returns the sum of a `CPoint` and a size or point, or a `CRect` offset by a size.|  \n|[CPoint::operator +=](#cpoint__operator__add_eq)|Offsets `CPoint` by adding a size or point.|  \n|[CPoint::operator -=](cpoint::operator%20-=.xml)|Offsets `CPoint` by subtracting a size or point.|  \n|[CPoint::operator ==](#cpoint__operator__eq_eq)|Checks for equality between two points.|  \n  \n## Remarks  \n It also includes member functions to manipulate `CPoint` and [POINT](../../mfc/reference/point-structure1.md) structures.  \n  \n A `CPoint` object can be used wherever a `POINT` structure is used. The operators of this class that interact with a \"size\" accept either [CSize](../../atl-mfc-shared/reference/csize-class.md) objects or [SIZE](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd145106) structures, since the two are interchangeable.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  This class is derived from the `tagPOINT` structure. (The name `tagPOINT` is a less commonly used name for the `POINT` structure.) This means that the data members of the `POINT` structure, `x` and `y`, are accessible data members of `CPoint`.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  For more information on shared utility classes (like `CPoint`), see [Shared Classes](../../atl-mfc-shared/atl-mfc-shared-classes.md).  \n  \n## Inheritance Hierarchy  \n `tagPOINT`  \n  \n `CPoint`  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Header:** atltypes.h  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cpoint__cpoint\"></a>  CPoint::CPoint  \n Constructs a `CPoint` object.  \n  \n```  \nCPoint() throw();\n\nCPoint(\n    int initX,  \n    int initY) throw();\n\nCPoint(\n    POINT initPt) throw();\n\nCPoint(\n    SIZE initSize) throw();\n\nCPoint(\n    LPARAM dwPoint) throw();\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `initX`  \n Specifies the value of the `x` member of `CPoint`.  \n  \n `initY`  \n Specifies the value of the `y` member of `CPoint`.  \n  \n `initPt`  \n [POINT](../../mfc/reference/point-structure1.md) structure or `CPoint` that specifies the values used to initialize `CPoint`.  \n  \n `initSize`  \n [SIZE](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd145106) structure or [CSize](../../atl-mfc-shared/reference/csize-class.md) that specifies the values used to initialize `CPoint`.  \n  \n `dwPoint`  \n Sets the `x` member to the low-order word of `dwPoint` and the `y` member to the high-order word of `dwPoint`.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n If no arguments are given, `x` and `y` members are set to 0.  \n  \n### Example  \n  \n```  \n \nCPoint   ptTopLeft(0,\n    0);\n\n \n// works from a POINT,\n    too  \n \nPOINT   ptHere;

otherwise 0.  \n  \n### Example  \n [!code-cpp[NVC_ATLMFC_Utilities#29](../../atl-mfc-shared/codesnippet/cpp/cpoint-class_2.cpp)]  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cpoint__operator__neq\"></a>  CPoint::operator !=  \n Checks for inequality between two points.  \n  \n```  \nBOOL operator!=(POINT point) const throw();\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `point`  \n Contains a [POINT](../../mfc/reference/point-structure1.md) structure or `CPoint` object.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Nonzero if the points are not equal; otherwise 0.  \n  \n### Example  \n [!code-cpp[NVC_ATLMFC_Utilities#30](../../atl-mfc-shared/codesnippet/cpp/cpoint-class_3.cpp)]  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cpoint__operator__add_eq\"></a>  CPoint::operator +=  \n The first overload adds a size to the `CPoint`.  \n  \n```  \nvoid operator+=(SIZE size) throw();\n\n \n    void operator+=(POINT point) throw();\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `size`  \n Contains a [SIZE](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd145106) structure or [CSize](../../atl-mfc-shared/reference/csize-class.md) object.  \n  \n `point`  \n Contains a [POINT](../../mfc/reference/point-structure1.md) structure or [CPoint](../../atl-mfc-shared/reference/cpoint-class.md) object.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The second overload adds a point to the `CPoint`.  \n  \n In both cases, addition is done by adding the **x** (or **cx**) member of the right-hand operand to the **x** member of the `CPoint` and adding the **y** (or **cy**) member of the right-hand operand to the **y** member of the `CPoint`.  \n  \n For example, adding `CPoint(5, -7)` to a variable which contains `CPoint(30, 40)` changes the variable to `CPoint(35, 33)`.  \n  \n### Example  \n [!code-cpp[NVC_ATLMFC_Utilities#31](../../atl-mfc-shared/codesnippet/cpp/cpoint-class_4.cpp)]  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cpoint__operator_-_eq\"></a>  CPoint::operator -=  \n The first overload subtracts a size from the `CPoint`.  \n  \n```  \nvoid operator-=(SIZE size) throw();\n\n \n    void operator-=(POINT point) throw();\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `size`  \n Contains a [SIZE](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd145106) structure or [CSize](../../atl-mfc-shared/reference/csize-class.md) object.  \n  \n `point`  \n Contains a [POINT](../../mfc/reference/point-structure1.md) structure or [CPoint](../../atl-mfc-shared/reference/cpoint-class.md) object.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The second overload subtracts a point from the `CPoint`.  \n  \n In both cases, subtraction is done by subtracting the **x** (or **cx**) member of the right-hand operand from the **x** member of the `CPoint` and subtracting the **y** (or **cy**) member of the right-hand operand from the **y** member of the `CPoint`.  \n  \n For example, subtracting `CPoint(5, -7)` from a variable which contains `CPoint(30, 40)` changes the variable to `CPoint(25, 47)`.  \n  \n### Example  \n [!code-cpp[NVC_ATLMFC_Utilities#32](../../atl-mfc-shared/codesnippet/cpp/cpoint-class_5.cpp)]  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cpoint__operator__add\"></a>  CPoint::operator +  \n Use this operator to offset `CPoint` by a `CPoint` or `CSize` object, or to offset a `CRect` by a `CPoint`.  \n  \n```  \nCPoint operator+(SIZE size) const throw();\n\n \n    CPoint operator+(POINT point) const throw();\n\n \n    CRect operator+(const RECT* lpRect) const throw();\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `size`  \n Contains a [SIZE](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd145106) structure or [CSize](../../atl-mfc-shared/reference/csize-class.md) object.  \n  \n `point`  \n Contains a [POINT](../../mfc/reference/point-structure1.md) structure or [CPoint](../../atl-mfc-shared/reference/cpoint-class.md) object.  \n  \n `lpRect`  \n Contains a pointer to a [RECT](../../mfc/reference/rect-structure1.md) structure or [CRect](../../atl-mfc-shared/reference/crect-class.md) object.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n A `CPoint` that is offset by a size, a **CPoint** that is offset by a point, or a **CRect** offset by a point.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n For example, using one of the first two overloads to offset the point `CPoint(25, -19)` by a point `CPoint(15, 5)` or size `CSize(15, 5)` returns the value `CPoint(40, -14)`.  \n  \n Adding a rectangle to a point returns the rectangle after being offset by the **x** and **y** values specified in the point. For example, using the last overload to offset a rectangle `CRect(125, 219, 325, 419)` by a point `CPoint(25, -19)` returns `CRect(150, 200, 350, 400)`.  \n  \n### Example  \n [!code-cpp[NVC_ATLMFC_Utilities#33](../../atl-mfc-shared/codesnippet/cpp/cpoint-class_6.cpp)]  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cpoint__operator_-\"></a>  CPoint::operator -  \n Use one of the first two overloads to subtract a `CPoint` or `CSize` object from `CPoint`.  \n  \n```  \nCSize operator-(POINT point) const throw();\n\n \n    CPoint operator-(SIZE size) const throw();\n\n \n    CRect operator-(const RECT* lpRect) const throw();\n\n \n    CPoint operator-() const throw();\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `point`  \n A [POINT](../../mfc/reference/point-structure1.md) structure or [CPoint](../../atl-mfc-shared/reference/cpoint-class.md) object.  \n  \n `size`  \n A [SIZE](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd145106) structure or [CSize](../../atl-mfc-shared/reference/csize-class.md) object.  \n  \n `lpRect`  \n A pointer to a [RECT](../../mfc/reference/rect-structure1.md) structure or a [CRect](../../atl-mfc-shared/reference/crect-class.md) object.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n A `CSize` that is the difference between two points, a `CPoint` that is offset by the negation of a size, a `CRect` that is offset by the negation of a point, or a `CPoint` that is the negation of a point.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The third overload offsets a `CRect` by the negation of `CPoint`. Finally, use the unary operator to negate `CPoint`.  \n  \n For example, using the first overload to find the difference between two points `CPoint(25, -19)` and `CPoint(15, 5)` returns `CSize(10, -24)`.  \n  \n Subtracting a `CSize` from `CPoint` does the same calculation as above but returns a `CPoint` object, not a `CSize` object. For example, using the second overload to find the difference between the point `CPoint(25, -19)` and the size `CSize(15, 5)` returns `CPoint(10, -24)`.  \n  \n Subtracting a rectangle from a point returns the rectangle offset by the negatives of the **x** and **y** values specified in the point. For example, using the last overload to offset the rectangle `CRect(125, 200, 325, 400)` by the point `CPoint(25, -19)` returns `CRect(100, 219, 300, 419)`.  \n  \n Use the unary operator to negate a point. For example, using the unary operator with the point `CPoint(25, -19)` returns `CPoint(-25, 19)`.  \n  \n### Example  \n [!code-cpp[NVC_ATLMFC_Utilities#34](../../atl-mfc-shared/codesnippet/cpp/cpoint-class_7.cpp)]  \n  \n## See Also  \n [MFC Sample MDI](../../visual-cpp-samples.md)   \n [Hierarchy Chart](../../mfc/hierarchy-chart.md)   \n [POINT Structure](../../mfc/reference/point-structure1.md)   \n [CRect Class](../../atl-mfc-shared/reference/crect-class.md)   \n [CSize Class](../../atl-mfc-shared/reference/csize-class.md)\n\n\n\n"}
