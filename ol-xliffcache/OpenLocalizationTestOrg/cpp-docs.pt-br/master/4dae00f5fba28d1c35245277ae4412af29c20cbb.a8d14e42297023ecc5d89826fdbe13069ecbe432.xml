They also support having control bars attached to them.  \n  \n In multiple document interface (MDI) applications, the main window is derived from `CMDIFrameWnd`. It indirectly contains the documents' frames, which are `CMDIChildWnd` objects. The `CMDIChildWnd` objects, in turn, contain the documents' views.  \n  \n In single document interface (SDI) applications, the main window, derived from `CFrameWnd`, contains the view of the current document.  \n  \n [CFrameWnd](../mfc/reference/cframewnd-class.md)  \n The base class for an SDI application's main frame window. Also the base class for all other frame window classes.  \n  \n [CMDIFrameWnd](../mfc/reference/cmdiframewnd-class.md)  \n The base class for an MDI application's main frame window.  \n  \n [CMDIChildWnd](../mfc/reference/cmdichildwnd-class.md)  \n The base class for an MDI application's document frame windows.  \n  \n [COleIPFrameWnd](../mfc/reference/coleipframewnd-class.md)  \n Provides the frame window for a view when a server document is being edited in place.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Class Overview](../mfc/class-library-overview.md)\n\n"}
