If the project contains a class associated with the interface, the wizard modifies the class, too.  \n  \n### To add a method to your object  \n  \n1.  In Class View, expand the project node to display the interface to which you want to add the method.  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  You can also add methods to dispinterfaces, which, unless the project is attributed, are located under the library node.  \n  \n2.  Right-click the name of the interface.  \n  \n3.  On the shortcut menu, click **Add**, and then click **Add Method**.  \n  \n4.  In the Add Method Wizard, provide the information to create the method.  \n  \n5.  Specify any interface definition language settings for this method in the [IDL attributes](../ide/idl-attributes-add-method-wizard.md) page of the wizard.  \n  \n6.  Click **Finish** to add the method.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Creating a COM Interface](../ide/creating-a-com-interface-visual-cpp.md)   \n [Editing a COM Interface](../ide/editing-a-com-interface.md)"}
