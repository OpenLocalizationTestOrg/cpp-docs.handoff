The given `symbol` may be a packaged function, created by compiling with [/Gy](../../build/reference/gy-enable-function-level-linking.md). This symbol was included in more than one file but was changed between compilations. Recompile all files that include the `symbol`.  \n  \n2.  The given `symbol` may have been defined differently in two member objects in different libraries.  \n  \n3.  An absolute may have been defined twice, with a different value in each definition.  \n  \n4.  If the error message is received when combining libraries, `symbol` already exists in the library being added to."}
