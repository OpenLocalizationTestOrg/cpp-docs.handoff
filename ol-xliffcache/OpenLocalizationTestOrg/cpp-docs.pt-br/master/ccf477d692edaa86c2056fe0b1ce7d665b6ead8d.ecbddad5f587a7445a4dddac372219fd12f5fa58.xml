When you set a property, the Resource editor initializes the control with the specified value. The property still can be changed programmatically.  \n  \n The **DataSource** property, which is found in all [data-bound controls](../../data/ado-rdo/databinding-with-activex-controls-in-visual-cpp.md), allows you to specify the [data source](../../data/ado-rdo/databinding-with-activex-controls-in-visual-cpp.md) control to which you want to bind.  \n  \n When binding simple bound ADO data-bound controls to an ADO data control (ADODC), you must associate the control with a column by setting the **DataField** property to a valid field in the rowset. Otherwise, the compiled application asserts in a running Debug build (the assertion is simply marking that the control has been bound to a null column).  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The **General** properties tab allows you to specify a control identifier and other properties needed for the .rc file. (The .rc file is later compiled to generate a Windows program resource code.)  \n  \n### To set a property on the All tab  \n  \n1.  [Insert an ActiveX control](../../data/ado-rdo/inserting-the-control-into-a-visual-cpp-application.md) into a dialog box.  \n  \n2.  Right-click the control in the Dialog editor, and then click **Properties**.  \n  \n3.  Click the **All** tab to display the control's properties. For a given property, enter the initialization value.  \n  \n To set control properties at run time, see [Modifying a Control's Run-Time Behavior](../../data/ado-rdo/modifying-a-control-s-run-time-behavior.md).  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Using ActiveX Controls](../../data/ado-rdo/using-activex-controls.md)"}
