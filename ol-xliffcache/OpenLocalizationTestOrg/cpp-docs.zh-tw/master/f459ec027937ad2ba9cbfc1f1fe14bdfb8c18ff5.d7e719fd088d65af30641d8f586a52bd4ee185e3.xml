The wizard will then create a class derived from `CAtlServiceModuleT` to implement the service.  \n  \n When the ATL COM object is built as a service, it will only be registered as a local server, and it will not appear in the list of services in Control Panel. This is because it is easier to debug the service as a local server than as a service. To install it as a service, run the following at the command prompt:  \n  \n `YourEXE` `.exe /Service`  \n  \n To uninstall it, run the following:  \n  \n `YourEXE` `.exe /UnregServer`  \n  \n The first four topics in this section discuss the actions that occur during execution of `CAtlServiceModuleT` member functions. These topics appear in the same sequence as the functions are typically called. To improve your understanding of these topics, it is a good idea to use the source code generated by the ATL Project Wizard as a reference. These first four topics are:  \n  \n\n-   [The CAtlServiceModuleT::Start Function](../atl/reference/catlservicemodulet-class.md#catlservicemodulet__start)  \n  \n-   [The CAtlServiceModuleT::ServiceMain Function](../atl/reference/catlservicemodulet-class.md#catlservicemodulet__servicemain)  \n  \n-   [The CAtlServiceModuleT::Run Function](../atl/reference/catlservicemodulet-class.md#catlservicemodulet__run)  \n  \n-   [The CAtlServiceModuleT::Handler Function](../atl/reference/catlservicemodulet-class.md#catlservicemodulet__handler)  \n  \n The last three topics discuss concepts related to developing a service:  \n  \n-   [Registry Entries](../atl/registry-entries.md) for ATL services  \n  \n-   [DCOMCNFG](../atl/dcomcnfg.md)  \n  \n-   [Debugging Tips](../atl/debugging-tips.md) for ATL services  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Concepts](../atl/active-template-library-atl-concepts.md)\n\n"}
