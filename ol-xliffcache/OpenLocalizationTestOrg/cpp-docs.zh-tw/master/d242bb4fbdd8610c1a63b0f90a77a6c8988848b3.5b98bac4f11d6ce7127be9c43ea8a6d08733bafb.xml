The <xref:System.IO.StreamWriter> constructor takes the name of the file to be created. If the file exists, it is overwritten (unless you pass True as the second <xref:System.IO.StringWriter> constructor argument).  \n  \n The file is then filed using the <xref:System.IO.StreamWriter.Write%2A> and <xref:System.IO.TextWriter.WriteLine%2A> functions.  \n  \n## Example  \n  \n```  \n// text_write.cpp  \n// compile with: /clr  \nusing namespace System;  \nusing namespace System::IO;  \n  \nint main()   \n{  \n   String^ fileName = \"textfile.txt\";  \n  \n   StreamWriter^ sw = gcnew StreamWriter(fileName);  \n   sw->WriteLine(\"A text file is born!\");  \n   sw->Write(\"You can use WriteLine\");  \n   sw->WriteLine(\"...or just Write\");  \n   sw->WriteLine(\"and do {0} output too.\", \"formatted\");  \n   sw->WriteLine(\"You can also send non-text objects:\");  \n   sw->WriteLine(DateTime::Now);  \n   sw->Close();  \n   Console::WriteLine(\"a new file ('{0}') has been written\", fileName);  \n  \n   return 0;  \n}  \n```  \n  \n## See Also  \n [File and Stream I-O](http://msdn.microsoft.com/Library/4f4a33a9-66b7-4cd7-a285-4ad3e4276cd2)   \n [.NET Programming with C++/CLI (Visual C++)](../dotnet/dotnet-programming-with-cpp-cli-visual-cpp.md)"}
