 \n```  \n  \n#### Parameters  \n status  \n The status code to return to the host environment.  \n  \n## Return Value  \n The `quick_exit` function cannot return to its caller.  \n  \n## Remarks  \n The `quick_exit` function causes normal program termination. It calls no functions registered by `atexit`, `_onexit` or signal handlers registered by the `signal` function. Behavior is undefined if `quick_exit` is called more than once, or if the `exit` function is also called.  \n  \n The `quick_exit` function calls, in last-in, first-out (LIFO) order, the functions registered by `at_quick_exit`, except for those functions already called when the function was registered.  Behavior is undefined if a [longjmp](../../c-runtime-library/reference/longjmp.md) call is made during a call to a registered function that would terminate the call to the  function.  \n  \n After the registered functions have been called, `quick_exit` invokes `_Exit` by using the `status` value to return control to the host environment.  \n  \n## Requirements  \n  \n|Routine|Required header|  \n|-------------|---------------------|  \n|`quick_exit`|\\<process.h> or \\<stdlib.h>|  \n  \n For more information about compatibility, see [Compatibility](../../c-runtime-library/compatibility.md).  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Process and Environment Control](../../c-runtime-library/process-and-environment-control.md)   \n [abort](../../c-runtime-library/reference/abort.md)   \n [atexit](../../c-runtime-library/reference/atexit.md)   \n [_exec, _wexec Functions](../../c-runtime-library/exec-wexec-functions.md)   \n [exit, _Exit, _exit](../../c-runtime-library/reference/exit-exit-exit.md)   \n [_onexit, _onexit_m](../../c-runtime-library/reference/onexit-onexit-m.md)   \n [_spawn, _wspawn Functions](../../c-runtime-library/spawn-wspawn-functions.md)   \n [system, _wsystem](../../c-runtime-library/reference/system-wsystem.md)"}
