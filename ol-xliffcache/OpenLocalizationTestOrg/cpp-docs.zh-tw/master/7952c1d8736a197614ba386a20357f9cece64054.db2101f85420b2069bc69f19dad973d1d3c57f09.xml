Nothing happens when a null statement is executed. The correct way to code a null statement is:  \n  \n## Syntax  \n  \n```  \n  \n;  \n  \n```  \n  \n## Remarks  \n Statements such as **do**, **for**, **if**, and `while` require that an executable statement appear as the statement body. The null statement satisfies the syntax requirement in cases that do not need a substantive statement body.  \n  \n As with any other C statement, you can include a label before a null statement. To label an item that is not a statement, such as the closing brace of a compound statement, you can label a null statement and insert it immediately before the item to get the same effect.  \n  \n This example illustrates the null statement:  \n  \n```  \nfor ( i = 0; i < 10; line[i++] = 0 )  \n     ;  \n```  \n  \n In this example, the loop expression of the **for** statement `line[i++] = 0` initializes the first 10 elements of `line` to 0. The statement body is a null statement, since no further statements are necessary.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Statements](../c-language/statements-c.md)"}
