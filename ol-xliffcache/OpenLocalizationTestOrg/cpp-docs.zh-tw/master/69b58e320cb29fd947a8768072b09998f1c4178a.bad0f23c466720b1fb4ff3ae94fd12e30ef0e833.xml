In MFC, this means that the same drawing calls, in the `OnDraw` member function of your view class, are responsible for drawing on the display and on other devices, such as printers. For print preview, the target device is a simulated printer output to the display.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"_core_your_role_in_printing_vs.._the_framework.92.s_role\"></a> Your Role in Printing vs. the Framework's Role  \n Your view class has the following responsibilities:  \n  \n-   Inform the framework how many pages are in the document.  \n  \n-   When asked to print a specified page, draw that portion of the document.  \n  \n-   Allocate and deallocate any fonts or other graphics device interface (GDI) resources needed for printing.  \n  \n-   If necessary, send any escape codes needed to change the printer mode before printing a given page, for example, to change the printing orientation on a per-page basis.  \n  \n The framework's responsibilities are as follows:  \n  \n-   Display the **Print** dialog box.  \n  \n-   Create a [CDC](../mfc/reference/cdc-class.md) object for the printer.  \n  \n-   Call the [StartDoc](../mfc/reference/cdc-class.md#cdc__startdoc) and [EndDoc](../mfc/reference/cdc-class.md#cdc__enddoc) member functions of the `CDC` object.  \n  \n-   Repeatedly call the [StartPage](../mfc/reference/cdc-class.md#cdc__startpage) member function of the `CDC` object, inform the view class which page should be printed, and call the [EndPage](../mfc/reference/cdc-class.md#cdc__endpage) member function of the `CDC` object.  \n  \n-   Call overridable functions in the view at the appropriate times.  \n  \n The following articles discuss how the framework supports printing and print preview:  \n  \n### What do you want to know more about  \n  \n-   [How default printing is done](../mfc/how-default-printing-is-done.md)  \n  \n-   [Multipage documents](../mfc/multipage-documents.md)  \n  \n-   [Headers and footers](../mfc/headers-and-footers.md)  \n  \n-   [Allocating GDI resources for printing](../mfc/allocating-gdi-resources.md)  \n  \n-   [Print preview](../mfc/print-preview-architecture.md)  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Printing and Print Preview](../mfc/printing-and-print-preview.md)\n\n"}
