Deployment planning starts when an application is created on a developer's computer. Deployment ends when the application is installed and ready to run on a user's computer.  \n  \n Visual Studio provides different technologies for deploying Windows applications. These include [!INCLUDE[ndptecclick](../ide/includes/ndptecclick_md.md)] deployment and Windows Installer deployment.  \n  \n-   [!INCLUDE[ndptecclick](../ide/includes/ndptecclick_md.md)] can be used to deploy C++ applications that target the common language runtime (CLR)—mixed, pure, and verifiable assemblies. Although you can use Windows Installer to deploy a managed application, we recommend that you use [!INCLUDE[ndptecclick](../ide/includes/ndptecclick_md.md)] because it takes advantage of .NET Framework security features such as manifest signing. [!INCLUDE[ndptecclick](../ide/includes/ndptecclick_md.md)] does not support deployment of native C++ applications. For more information, see [ClickOnce Deployment for Visual C++ Applications](../ide/clickonce-deployment-for-visual-cpp-applications.md).  \n  \n-   Windows Installer technology can be used to deploy either native C++ applications or C++ applications that target the CLR.  \n  \n The articles in this section of the documentation discuss how to ensure that a native Visual C++ application runs on any computer that provides a supported target platform, which files you must include in an installation package, and the recommended ways to redistribute the components that your application depends on.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Deployment in Visual C++](../ide/deployment-in-visual-cpp.md)  \n  \n [Deployment Concepts](../ide/deployment-concepts.md)  \n  \n [Understanding the Dependencies of a Visual C++ Application](../ide/understanding-the-dependencies-of-a-visual-cpp-application.md)  \n  \n [Determining Which DLLs to Redistribute](../ide/determining-which-dlls-to-redistribute.md)  \n  \n [Choosing a Deployment Method](../ide/choosing-a-deployment-method.md)  \n  \n [Redistributing Visual C++ Files](../ide/redistributing-visual-cpp-files.md)  \n  \n [Deployment Examples](../ide/deployment-examples.md)  \n  \n [Redistributing Web Client Applications](../ide/redistributing-web-client-applications.md)  \n  \n [ClickOnce Deployment for Visual C++ Applications](../ide/clickonce-deployment-for-visual-cpp-applications.md)  \n  \n [Running a C++ /clr Application on a Previous Runtime Version](../ide/running-a-cpp-clr-application-on-a-previous-runtime-version.md)  \n  \n## Related Sections  \n [Building C/C++ Isolated Applications and Side-by-side Assemblies](../build/building-c-cpp-isolated-applications-and-side-by-side-assemblies.md)  \n  \n [Deployment](http://msdn.microsoft.com/Library/238d8284-6042-4a38-a7f6-1ee8efd719da)  \n  \n [Troubleshooting C/C++ Isolated Applications and Side-by-side Assemblies](../build/troubleshooting-c-cpp-isolated-applications-and-side-by-side-assemblies.md)"}
