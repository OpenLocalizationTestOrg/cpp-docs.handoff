Choose one of the following:  \n  \n    -   Change the targeted framework in the project's **Property Pages** dialog box so that it is later than or equal to the minimal framework version of all referenced assemblies and projects. For more information, see [Adding references](../../ide/adding-references-in-visual-cpp-projects.md).  \n  \n    -   Remove the reference to the assembly or project that has a minimal framework version that is later than the targeted framework. These items will be marked with a warning icon in the project's **Property Pages**.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Project Build Errors and Warnings (PRJxxxx)](../../error-messages/tool-errors/project-build-errors-and-warnings-prjxxxx.md)"}
