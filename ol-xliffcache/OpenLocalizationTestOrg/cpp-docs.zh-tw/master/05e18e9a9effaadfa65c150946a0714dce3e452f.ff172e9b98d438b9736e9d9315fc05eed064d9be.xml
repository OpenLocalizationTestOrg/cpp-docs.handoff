Follow the instructions in the topic [Creating a Project with a Visual C++ Application Wizard](../../ide/creating-desktop-projects-by-using-application-wizards.md).  \n  \n2.  Select the **ATL Project** icon in the Templates pane to open the ATL Project Wizard.  \n  \n3.  Define your application settings using the [Application Settings](../../atl/reference/application-settings-atl-project-wizard.md) page of the `ATL Project Wizard`.  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  Skip this step to keep the wizard default settings.  \n  \n4.  Click **Finish** to close the wizard and open your new project in the development environment.  \n  \n Once your project is created, you can view the files created in **Solution Explorer**. For more information about the files the wizard creates for your project, see the project-generated file ReadMe.txt. For more information about the file types, see [File Types Created for Visual C++ Projects](../../ide/file-types-created-for-visual-cpp-projects.md). For more information about the configurations for the new ATL project, and how to change them, see [Default ATL Project Configurations](../../atl/reference/default-atl-project-configurations.md).  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Adding Functionality with Code Wizards](../../ide/adding-functionality-with-code-wizards-cpp.md)   \n [Property Pages](../../ide/property-pages-visual-cpp.md)   \n [Deploying Applications](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/4ff8881d-0daf-47e7-bfe7-774c625031b4)\n\n"}
