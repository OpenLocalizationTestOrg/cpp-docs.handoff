A record consists of a group of contiguous columns (sometimes called fields) that contain data of various types. A set of records selected from a data source — often called a result set in database terms — is called a recordset in MFC. For more information, see [Recordset (ODBC)](../data/odbc/recordset-odbc.md).  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Data Access Programming (MFC/ATL)](../data/data-access-programming-mfc-atl.md)"}
