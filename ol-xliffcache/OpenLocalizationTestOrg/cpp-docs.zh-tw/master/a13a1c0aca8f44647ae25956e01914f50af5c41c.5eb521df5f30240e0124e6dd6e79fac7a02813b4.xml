covers window objects in the MFC framework. All MFC windows derive from class [CWnd](../mfc/reference/cwnd-class.md), including frame windows, views, dialog boxes, and controls.  \n  \n The first group of articles describes [window objects](../mfc/window-objects.md) in general. Refer to this group for general information about C++ window objects, how they encapsulate an HWND, and how you use them when creating your own windows, such as child windows.  \n  \n The second group of articles describes [frame windows](../mfc/frame-windows.md)—windows that put a frame around content — in particular. Refer to this group for information about how the MFC framework manages frame windows and the contents that they frame, including control bars and views.  \n  \n## What do you want to know more about  \n *Topics on Window Objects in General*  \n  \n-   [Window objects](../mfc/window-objects.md)  \n  \n-   [Relationship between a C++ window objects and HWND handles](../mfc/relationship-between-a-cpp-window-object-and-an-hwnd.md)  \n  \n-   [Derived Window classes](../mfc/derived-window-classes.md)  \n  \n-   [Creating window objects](../mfc/creating-windows.md)  \n  \n-   [Destroying Window Objects](../mfc/destroying-window-objects.md)  \n  \n-   [Registering window \"classes\"](../mfc/registering-window-classes.md)  \n  \n-   [Working with window objects](../mfc/working-with-window-objects.md)  \n  \n-   [Device contexts](../mfc/device-contexts.md): objects that make Windows drawing device-independent  \n  \n-   [Graphic objects](../mfc/graphic-objects.md): pens, brushes, fonts, bitmaps, palettes, regions  \n  \n *Frame Window Topics*  \n  \n-   [Frame windows](../mfc/frame-windows.md): window objects that provide frames  \n  \n-   [Frame windows and views](../mfc/frame-windows.md)  \n  \n-   [Frame-window classes](../mfc/frame-window-classes.md)  \n  \n-   [Frame-window styles](../mfc/frame-window-styles-cpp.md)  \n  \n-   [Changing the styles of a window created by MFC](../mfc/changing-the-styles-of-a-window-created-by-mfc.md)  \n  \n-   [What frame windows do](../mfc/what-frame-windows-do.md)  \n  \n-   [Using frame windows](../mfc/using-frame-windows.md)  \n  \n-   [Managing MD/Child windows (the MDICLIENT window)](../mfc/managing-mdi-child-windows.md)  \n  \n-   [Managing menus, control bars, and accelerators](../mfc/managing-menus-control-bars-and-accelerators.md)  \n  \n-   [CFrameWnd](../mfc/reference/cframewnd-class.md)  \n  \n-   [CMDIFrameWnd](../mfc/reference/cmdiframewnd-class.md)  \n  \n-   [CMDIChildWnd](../mfc/reference/cmdichildwnd-class.md)  \n  \n-   [Using Views](../mfc/using-views.md)  \n  \n-   [Multiple Document Types, Views, and Frame Windows (Splitter windows)](../mfc/multiple-document-types-views-and-frame-windows.md)  \n  \n-   [Messages (maps and handler functions)](../mfc/messages.md)  \n  \n *Create and Destroy Windows*  \n  \n-   [General Window Creation Sequence](../mfc/general-window-creation-sequence.md)  \n  \n-   [Destroy window objects](../mfc/destroying-window-objects.md)  \n  \n-   [Create document frame windows](../mfc/creating-document-frame-windows.md)  \n  \n-   [Destroy frame windows](../mfc/destroying-frame-windows.md)  \n  \n *Create Splitter Windows*  \n  \n-   [Create splitter windows](../mfc/multiple-document-types-views-and-frame-windows.md)  \n  \n *Manage Child Windows and the Current View*  \n  \n-   [Manage MDI child windows](../mfc/managing-mdi-child-windows.md)  \n  \n-   [Manage the current view](../mfc/managing-the-current-view.md)  \n  \n-   [Manage menus, control bars, and accelerators](../mfc/managing-menus-control-bars-and-accelerators.md)  \n  \n *Work with Device Contexts and Window Styles*  \n  \n-   [Use pens and other graphic objects in a device context](../mfc/graphic-objects.md)  \n  \n-   [Change the styles of a window created by MFC](../mfc/changing-the-styles-of-a-window-created-by-mfc.md)  \n  \n## See Also  \n [User Interface Elements](../mfc/user-interface-elements-mfc.md)   \n [Dialog Boxes](../mfc/dialog-boxes.md)   \n [Toolbars](../mfc/toolbars.md)   \n [Status Bars](../mfc/status-bars.md)   \n [Dialog Bars](../mfc/dialog-bars.md)\n\n"}
