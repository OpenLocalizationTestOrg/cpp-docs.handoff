Implementations of many interfaces are included in the COM libraries available with Visual Studio and Windows. An interface implementation is associated with an object when an instance of that object is created, and it provides the services that the object offers.  \n  \n For a discussion of interfaces and implementations, see [Interfaces and Interface Implementations](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms694356) in the [!INCLUDE[winsdkshort](../atl-mfc-shared/reference/includes/winsdkshort_md.md)].  \n  \n **Implement interface from**  \n Specifies the location of the type library, from which the interface is created.  \n  \n|Option|Description|  \n|------------|-----------------|  \n|**Project**|The type library is part of the project.|  \n|**Registry**|The type library is registered in the system. Registered type libraries are listed in **Available type libraries**.|  \n|**File**|The type library is not necessarily registered in the system but is contained in a file. You must provide the file location in **Location**.|  \n  \n **Available type libraries**  \n Displays the available type libraries containing the interface definitions that you can implement.
