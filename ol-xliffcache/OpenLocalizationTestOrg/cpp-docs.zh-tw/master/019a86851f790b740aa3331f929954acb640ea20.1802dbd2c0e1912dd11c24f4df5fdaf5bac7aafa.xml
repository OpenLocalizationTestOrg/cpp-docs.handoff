For example, `CWnd::Create` is in the constructors section because before you use the `CWnd` object, it must be \"fully constructed\" by first calling the C++ constructor and then calling the **Create** function. Typically, these members are public.  \n  \n For example, class `CStdioFile` has three constructors, one of which is shown in the listing under [An Example of the Comments](../mfc/an-example-of-the-comments.md).  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Using the MFC Source Files](../mfc/using-the-mfc-source-files.md)   \n [// Implementation Comment](../mfc/decrement-implementation-comment.md)   \n [// Attributes Comment](../mfc/decrement-attributes-comment.md)   \n [// Operations Comment](../mfc/decrement-operations-comment.md)   \n [// Overridables Comment](../mfc/decrement-overridables-comment.md)\n\n"}
