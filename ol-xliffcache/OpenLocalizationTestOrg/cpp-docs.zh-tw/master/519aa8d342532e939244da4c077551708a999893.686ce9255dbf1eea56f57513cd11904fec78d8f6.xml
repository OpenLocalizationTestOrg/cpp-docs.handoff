If an inferred dependent is out-of-date with respect to its target, NMAKE invokes the commands block for the dependency. If an inferred dependent does not exist or is out-of-date with respect to its own dependents, NMAKE first updates the inferred dependent. For more information about inferred dependents, see [Inference Rules](../build/inference-rules.md).  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Dependents](../build/dependents.md)"}
