This provides the user with a very intuitive and recognizable method of entering or selecting a date. The control also provides the application with the means to obtain and set the date information in the control using existing data types. By default, the month calendar control displays the current day and month. However, the user is able to scroll to the previous and next months and select a specific month and/or year.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  To use the `CMonthCalCtrl` class in your project, you must include AFXDTCTL.H, usually in STDAFX.H.  \n  \n## What do you want to know more about  \n  \n-   [Creating the Month Calendar Control](../mfc/creating-the-month-calendar-control.md)  \n  \n-   [Month Calendar Control Examples](../mfc/month-calendar-control-examples.md)  \n  \n-   [Processing Notification Messages in Month Calendar Controls](../mfc/processing-notification-messages-in-month-calendar-controls.md)  \n  \n-   [Setting the Day State of a Month Calendar Control](../mfc/setting-the-day-state-of-a-month-calendar-control.md)  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Controls](../mfc/controls-mfc.md)\n\n"}
