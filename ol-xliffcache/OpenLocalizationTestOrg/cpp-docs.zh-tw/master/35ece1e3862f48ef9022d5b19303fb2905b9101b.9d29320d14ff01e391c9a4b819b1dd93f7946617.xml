These represent options available rather than a sequence of steps to perform.  \n  \n### Creating OLE Applications  \n  \n|Task|You do|The framework does|  \n|----------|------------|------------------------|  \n|Create a COM component.|Run the MFC Application Wizard. Choose **Full-server** or **Mini-server** in the **Compound Document Support** tab.|The framework generates a skeleton application with COM component capability enabled. All of the COM capability can be transferred to your existing application with only slight modification.|  \n|Create a container application from scratch.|Run the MFC Application Wizard. Choose **Container** in the **Compound Document Support** tab. Using Class View, go to the source code editor. Fill in code for your COM handler functions.|The framework generates a skeleton application that can insert COM objects created by COM component (server) applications.|  \n|Create an application that supports Automation from scratch.|Run the MFC Application Wizard. Choose **Automation** from the **Advanced Features** tab. Use Class View to expose methods and properties in your application for automation.|The framework generates a skeleton application that can be activated and automated by other applications.|  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Building on the Framework](../mfc/building-on-the-framework.md)   \n [Sequence of Operations for Building MFC Applications](../mfc/sequence-of-operations-for-building-mfc-applications.md)   \n [Sequence of Operations for Creating ActiveX Controls](../mfc/sequence-of-operations-for-creating-activex-controls.md)   \n [Sequence of Operations for Creating Database Applications](../mfc/sequence-of-operations-for-creating-database-applications.md)\n\n"}
