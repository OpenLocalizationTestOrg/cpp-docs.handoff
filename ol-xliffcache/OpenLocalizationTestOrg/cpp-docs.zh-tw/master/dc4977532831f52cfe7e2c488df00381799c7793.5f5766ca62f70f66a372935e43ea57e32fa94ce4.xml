Such programs must list all such variables as arguments to a `lastprivate` clause ([Section 2.7.2.3](../../parallel/openmp/2-7-2-3-lastprivate.md) on page 27) so that the values of the variables are the same as when the loop is executed sequentially.  \n  \n```  \n#pragma omp parallel  \n{  \n   #pragma omp for lastprivate(i)  \n      for (i=0; i<n-1; i++)  \n         a[i] = b[i] + b[i+1];  \n}  \na[i]=b[i];  \n```  \n  \n In the preceding example, the value of `i` at the end of the parallel region will equal `n–1`, as in the sequential case."}
