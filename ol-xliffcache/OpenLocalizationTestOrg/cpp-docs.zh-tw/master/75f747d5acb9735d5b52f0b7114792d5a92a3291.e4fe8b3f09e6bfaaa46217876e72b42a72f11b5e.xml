represents a smart pointer object.  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  This class and its members cannot be used in applications that execute in the Windows Runtime.  \n  \n## Syntax  \n  \n```\ntemplate <typename   T>\n    class CAutoPtr\n```  \n  \n#### Parameters  \n `T`  \n The pointer type.  \n  \n## Members  \n  \n### Public Constructors  \n  \n|Name|Description|  \n|----------|-----------------|  \n|[CAutoPtr::CAutoPtr](#cautoptr__cautoptr)|The constructor.|  \n|[CAutoPtr::~CAutoPtr](#cautoptr___dtorcautoptr)|The destructor.|  \n  \n### Public Methods  \n

\n|----------|-----------------|  \n|[CAutoPtr::m_p](#cautoptr__m_p)|The pointer data member variable.|  \n  \n## Remarks  \n This class provides methods for creating and managing a smart pointer, which will help protect against memory leaks by automatically freeing resources when it falls out of scope.  \n  \n Further, `CAutoPtr`'s copy constructor and assignment operator transfer ownership of the pointer, copying the source pointer to the destination pointer and setting the source pointer to NULL. It is therefore impossible to have two `CAutoPtr` objects each storing the same pointer, and this reduces the possibility of deleting the same pointer twice.  \n  \n `CAutoPtr` also simplifies the creation of collections of pointers. Instead of deriving a collection class and overriding the destructor, it's simpler to make a collection of `CAutoPtr` objects. When the collection is deleted, the `CAutoPtr` objects will go out of scope and automatically delete themselves.  \n  \n [CHeapPtr](../../atl/reference/cheapptr-class.md) and variants work in the same way as `CAutoPtr`, except that they allocate and free memory using different heap functions instead of the C++ **new** and **delete** operators. [CAutoVectorPtr](../../atl/reference/cautovectorptr-class.md) is similar to `CAutoPtr`, the only difference being that it uses **vector new[]** and **vector delete[]** to allocate and free memory.  \n  \n See also [CAutoPtrArray](../../atl/reference/cautoptrarray-class.md) and [CAutoPtrList](../../atl/reference/cautoptrlist-class.md) when arrays or lists of smart pointers are required.  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Header:** atlbase.h  \n  \n## Example  \n [!code-cpp[NVC_ATL_Utilities#74](../../atl/codesnippet/cpp/cautoptr-class_1.cpp)]  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cautoptr__attach\"></a>  CAutoPtr::Attach  \n Call this method to take ownership of an existing pointer.  \n  \n```\nvoid Attach(T* p) throw();\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `p`  \n The `CAutoPtr` object will take ownership of this pointer.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n When a `CAutoPtr` object takes ownership of a pointer, it will automatically delete the pointer and any allocated data when it goes out of scope. If [CAutoPtr::Detach](#cautoptr__detach) is called, the programmer is again given responsibility for freeing any allocated resources.  \n  \n In debug builds, an assertion failure will occur if the [CAutoPtr::m_p](#cautoptr__m_p) data member currently points to an existing value; that is, it is not equal to NULL.  \n  \n### Example  \n See the example in the [CAutoPtr Overview](../../atl/reference/cautoptr-class.md).  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cautoptr__cautoptr\"></a>  CAutoPtr::CAutoPtr  \n The constructor.  \n  \n```\nCAutoPtr() throw();\nexplicit CAutoPtr(T* p) throw();\n\ntemplate<typename TSrc> CAutoPtr(CAutoPtr<TSrc>& p) throw();\n\ntemplate<> CAutoPtr(CAutoPtr<T>& p) throw();\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `p`  \n An existing pointer.  \n  \n `TSrc`  \n The type being managed by another `CAutoPtr`, used to initialize the current object.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The `CAutoPtr` object can be created using an existing pointer, in which case it transfers ownership of the pointer.  \n  \n### Example  \n See the example in the [CAutoPtr Overview](../../atl/reference/cautoptr-class.md).  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cautoptr___dtorcautoptr\"></a>  CAutoPtr::~CAutoPtr  \n The destructor.  \n  \n```\n~CAutoPtr() throw();\n```  \n  \n### Remarks  \n Frees any allocated resources. Calls [CAutoPtr::Free](#cautoptr__free).  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cautoptr__detach\"></a>  CAutoPtr::Detach  \n Call this method to release ownership of a pointer.  \n  \n```\nT* Detach() throw();\n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Returns a copy of the pointer.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n Releases ownership of a pointer, sets the [CAutoPtr::m_p](#cautoptr__m_p) data member variable to NULL, and returns a copy of the pointer. After calling **Detach**, it is up to the programmer to free any allocated resources over which the `CAutoPtr` object may have previously assumed reponsibility.  \n  \n### Example  \n See the example in the [CAutoPtr Overview](../../atl/reference/cautoptr-class.md).  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cautoptr__free\"></a>  CAutoPtr::Free  \n Call this method to delete an object pointed to by a `CAutoPtr`.  \n  \n```\nvoid Free() throw();\n```  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The object pointed to by the `CAutoPtr` is freed, and the [CAutoPtr::m_p](#cautoptr__m_p) data member variable is set to NULL.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cautoptr__m_p\"></a>  CAutoPtr::m_p  \n The pointer data member variable.  \n  \n```\nT* m_p;\n```  \n  \n### Remarks  \n This member variable holds the pointer information.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cautoptr__operator_eq\"></a>  CAutoPtr::operator =  \n The assignment operator.  \n  \n```\ntemplate<>\nCAutoPtr<T>& operator= (CAutoPtr<T>& p);\n\ntemplate<typename TSrc>\nCAutoPtr<T>& operator= (CAutoPtr<TSrc>& p);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `p`  \n A pointer.  \n  \n `TSrc`  \n A class type.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Returns a reference to a **CAutoPtr\\< T >**.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The assignment operator detaches the `CAutoPtr` object from any current pointer and attaches the new pointer, `p`, in its place.  \n  \n### Example  \n See the example in the [CAutoPtr Overview](../../atl/reference/cautoptr-class.md).  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cautoptr__operator_ptr\"></a>  CAutoPtr::operator -&gt;  \n The pointer-to-member operator.  \n  \n```\nT* operator->() const throw();\n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Returns the value of the [CAutoPtr::m_p](#cautoptr__m_p) data member variable.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n Use this operator to call a method in a class pointed to by the `CAutoPtr` object. In debug builds, an assertion failure will occur if the `CAutoPtr` points to NULL.  \n  \n### Example  \n See the example in the [CAutoPtr Overview](../../atl/reference/cautoptr-class.md).  \n  \n##  <a name=\"cautoptr__operator_t_star\"></a>  CAutoPtr::operator T*  \n The cast operator.  \n  \n```operator T* () const throw();\n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Returns a pointer to the object data type defined in the class template.  \n  \n### Example  \n See the example in the [CAutoPtr Overview](../../atl/reference/cautoptr-class.md).  \n  \n## See Also  \n [CHeapPtr Class](../../atl/reference/cheapptr-class.md)   \n [CAutoVectorPtr Class](../../atl/reference/cautovectorptr-class.md)   \n [Class Overview](../../atl/atl-class-overview.md)\n"}
