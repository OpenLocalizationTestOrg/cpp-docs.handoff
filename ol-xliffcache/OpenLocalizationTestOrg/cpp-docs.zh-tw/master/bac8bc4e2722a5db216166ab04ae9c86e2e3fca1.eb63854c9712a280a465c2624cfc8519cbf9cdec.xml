For each variable specified in a **copyin** clause, the value of the variable in the master thread of the team is copied, as if by assignment, to the thread-private copies at the beginning of the parallel region. The syntax of the **copyin** clause is as follows:  \n  \n```  \n  \ncopyin(  \nvariable-list  \n)  \n  \n```  \n  \n The restrictions to the **copyin** clause are as follows:  \n  \n-   A variable that is specified in the **copyin** clause must have an accessible, unambiguous copy assignment operator.  \n  \n-   A variable that is specified in the **copyin** clause must be a **threadprivate** variable."}
