So, the compiler will automatically deallocate the memory occupied by the object after the exception is thrown.  \n  \n For more information, see [Exceptions: Freeing Objects in Exceptions](../mfc/exceptions-freeing-objects-in-exceptions.md).  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Exception Handling](../mfc/exception-handling-in-mfc.md)\n\n"}
