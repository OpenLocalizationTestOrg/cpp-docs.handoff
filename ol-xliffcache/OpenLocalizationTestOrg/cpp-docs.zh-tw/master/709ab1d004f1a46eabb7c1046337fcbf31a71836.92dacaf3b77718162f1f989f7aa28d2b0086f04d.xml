A function definition includes the function body.  \n  \n## Remarks  \n Both function and variable declarations can appear inside or outside a function definition. Any declaration within a function definition is said to appear at the \"internal\" or \"local\" level. A declaration outside all function definitions is said to appear at the \"external,\" \"global,\" or \"file scope\" level. Variable definitions, like declarations, can appear at the internal level (within a function definition) or at the external level (outside all function definitions). Function definitions always occur at the external level. Function definitions are discussed further in [Function Definitions](../c-language/c-function-definitions.md). Function prototypes are covered in [Function Prototypes](../c-language/function-prototypes.md).  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Source Files and Source Programs](../c-language/source-files-and-source-programs.md)"}
