In ATL 7.0, `CComModule` functionality is replaced by several classes:  \n  \n-   [CAtlBaseModule](../atl/reference/catlbasemodule-class.md) Contains information required by most applications that use ATL. Contains the HINSTANCE of the module and the resource instance.  \n  \n-   [CAtlComModule](../atl/reference/catlcommodule-class.md) Contains information required by the COM classes in ATL.  \n  \n-   [CAtlWinModule](../atl/reference/catlwinmodule-class.md) Contains information required by the windowing classes in ATL.  \n  \n-   [CAtlDebugInterfacesModule](../atl/reference/catldebuginterfacesmodule-class.md) Contains support for interface debugging.  \n  \n-   [CAtlModule](../atl/reference/catlmodule-class.md) The following `CAtlModule`-derived classes are customized to contain information required in a particular application type. Most members in these classes can be overridden:  \n  \n    -   [CAtlDllModuleT](../atl/reference/catldllmodulet-class.md) Used in DLL applications. Provides code for the standard exports.  \n  \n    -   [CAtlExeModuleT](../atl/reference/catlexemodulet-class.md) Used in EXE applications. Provides code required in an EXE.  \n  \n    -   [CAtlServiceModuleT](../atl/reference/catlservicemodulet-class.md) Provides support to create Windows NT and Windows 2000 Services.  \n  \n `CComModule` is still available for backward compatibility.  \n  \n## Reasons for Distributing CComModule Functionality  \n The functionality of `CComModule` was distributed into several new classes for the following reasons:  \n  \n-   Make the functionality in `CComModule` granular.  \n  \n     Support for COM, windowing, interface debugging, and application-specific (DLL or EXE) features is now in separate classes.  \n  \n-   Automatically declare global instance of each of these modules.  \n  \n     A global instance of the required module classes is linked into the project.  \n  \n-   Remove the necessity of calling Init and Term methods.  \n  \n     Init and Term methods have moved into the constructors and destructors for the module classes; there is no longer a need to call Init and Term.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Concepts](../atl/active-template-library-atl-concepts.md)   \n [Class Overview](../atl/atl-class-overview.md)\n\n"}
