They are also useful for unbuffered or binary I/O if you need a C++ programming interface and decide not to use the Microsoft Foundation Class (MFC) library. The iostream classes are an object-oriented I/O alternative to the C run-time functions.  \n  \n You can use iostream classes with the Microsoft Windows operating system. String and file streams work without restrictions, but the character-mode stream objects `cin`, `cout`, `cerr`, and `clog` are inconsistent with the Windows graphical user interface. You can also derive custom stream classes that interact directly with the Windows environment.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [What a Stream Is](../standard-library/what-a-stream-is.md)\n\n"}
