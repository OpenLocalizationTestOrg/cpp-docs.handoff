\n```  \nvoid *calloc(   \n   size_t num,  \n   size_t size   \n);  \n```  \n  \n#### Parameters  \n `num`  \n Number of elements.  \n  \n `size`  \n Length in bytes of each element.  \n  \n## Return Value  \n `calloc` returns a pointer to the allocated space. The storage space pointed to by the return value is guaranteed to be suitably aligned for storage of any type of object. To get a pointer to a type other than `void`, use a type cast on the return value.  \n  \n## Remarks  \n The `calloc` function allocates storage space for an array of `num` elements, each of length `size` bytes. Each element is initialized to 0.  \n  \n `calloc` sets `errno` to `ENOMEM` if a memory allocation fails or if the amount of memory requested exceeds `_HEAP_MAXREQ`. For information on this and other error codes, see [errno, _doserrno, _sys_errlist, and _sys_nerr](../../c-runtime-library/errno-doserrno-sys-errlist-and-sys-nerr.md).  \n  \n `calloc` calls `malloc` to use the C++ [_set_new_mode](../../c-runtime-library/reference/set-new-mode.md) function to set the new handler mode. The new handler mode indicates whether, on failure, `malloc` is to call the new handler routine as set by [_set_new_handler](../../c-runtime-library/reference/set-new-handler.md). By default, `malloc` does not call the new handler routine on failure to allocate memory. You can override this default behavior so that, when `calloc` fails to allocate memory, `malloc` calls the new handler routine in the same way that the `new` operator does when it fails for the same reason. To override the default, call  \n  \n```  \n_set_new_mode(1)  \n```  \n  \n early in your program, or link with NEWMODE.OBJ (see [Link Options](../../c-runtime-library/link-options.md)).  \n  \n When the application is linked with a debug version of the C run-time libraries, `calloc` resolves to [_calloc_dbg](../../c-runtime-library/reference/calloc-dbg.md). For more information about how the heap is managed during the debugging process, see [The CRT Debug Heap](/visualstudio/debugger/crt-debug-heap-details).  \n  \n `calloc` is marked `__declspec(noalias)` and `__declspec(restrict)`, meaning that the function is guaranteed not to modify global variables, and that the pointer returned is not aliased. For more information, see [noalias](../../cpp/noalias.md) and [restrict](../../cpp/restrict.md).  \n  \n## Requirements  \n  \n|Routine|Required header|  \n|-------------|---------------------|  \n|`calloc`|\\<stdlib.h> and \\<malloc.h>|  \n  \n For additional compatibility information, see [Compatibility](../../c-runtime-library/compatibility.md) in the Introduction.  \n  \n## Example  \n  \n```  \n// crt_calloc.c  \n// This program uses calloc to allocate space for  \n// 40 long integers. It initializes each element to zero.  \n  \n#include <stdio.h>  \n#include <malloc.h>  \n  \nint main( void )  \n{  \n   long *buffer;  \n  \n   buffer = (long *)calloc( 40, sizeof( long ) );  \n   if( buffer != NULL )  \n      printf( \"Allocated 40 long integers\\n\" );  \n   else  \n      printf( \"Can't allocate memory\\n\" );  \n   free( buffer );  \n}  \n```  \n  \n```Output  \nAllocated 40 long integers  \n```  \n  \n## .NET Framework Equivalent  \n Not applicable. To call the standard C function, use `PInvoke`. For more information, see [Platform Invoke Examples](http://msdn.microsoft.com/Library/15926806-f0b7-487e-93a6-4e9367ec689f).  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Memory Allocation](../../c-runtime-library/memory-allocation.md)   \n [free](../../c-runtime-library/reference/free.md)   \n [malloc](../../c-runtime-library/reference/malloc.md)   \n [realloc](../../c-runtime-library/reference/realloc.md)"}
