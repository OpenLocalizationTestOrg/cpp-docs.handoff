Open the project property pages for the COM component.  \n  \n2.  Expand the **Configuration Properties** node, and then expand the **Manifest Tool** node.  \n  \n3.  Select the **Input and Output** property page, and then set the **Embed Manifest** property equal to **Yes**.  \n  \n4.  Click **OK**.  \n  \n5.  Build the solution.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Isolated Applications](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa375190)   \n [About Side-by-Side Assemblies](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ff951640)   \n [How to: Build Isolated Applications to Consume COM Components](../build/how-to-build-isolated-applications-to-consume-com-components.md)"}
