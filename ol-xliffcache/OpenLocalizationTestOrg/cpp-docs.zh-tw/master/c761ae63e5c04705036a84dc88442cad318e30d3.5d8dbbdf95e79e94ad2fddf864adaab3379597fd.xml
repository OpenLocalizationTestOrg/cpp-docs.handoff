The actual \"time in the past\" is arbitrary, but it is guaranteed not to change during the execution of the application program. The format is as follows:  \n  \n```  \n#include <omp.h>  \ndouble omp_get_wtime(void);  \n```  \n  \n It is anticipated that the function will be used to measure elapsed times as shown in the following example:  \n  \n```  \ndouble start;  \ndouble end;  \nstart = omp_get_wtime();  \n... work to be timed ...  \nend = omp_get_wtime();  \nprintf_s(\"Work took %f sec. time.\\n\", end-start);  \n```  \n  \n The times returned are \"per-thread times\" by which is meant they are not required to be globally consistent across all the threads participating in an application."}
