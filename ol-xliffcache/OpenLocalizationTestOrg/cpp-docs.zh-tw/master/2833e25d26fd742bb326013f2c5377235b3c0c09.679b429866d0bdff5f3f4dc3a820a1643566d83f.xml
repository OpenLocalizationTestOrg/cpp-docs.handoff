A literal type is either `void`, a scalar type, a reference type, an array of literal type, or a literal class type. A literal class type is a class type that has a trivial destructor, is either an aggregate type or has at least one non-move, non-copy `constexpr` constructor, and all of its base classes and non-static data members are non-volatile literal types. While the type of a literal is always a literal type, the concept of a literal type includes anything that the compiler can evaluate as a `constexpr` at compile time.  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Header:** <type_traits>  \n  \n **Namespace:** std  \n  \n## See Also  \n [<type_traits>](../standard-library/type-traits.md)\n\n\n\n"}
