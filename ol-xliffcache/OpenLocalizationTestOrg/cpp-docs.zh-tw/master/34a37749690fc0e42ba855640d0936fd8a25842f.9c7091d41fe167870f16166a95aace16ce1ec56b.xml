The three most important output stream classes are `ostream`, `ofstream`, and `ostringstream`.  \n  \n The `ostream` class, through the derived class `basic_ostream`, supports the predefined stream objects:  \n  \n-   `cout` standard output  \n  \n-   `cerr` standard error with limited buffering  \n  \n-   `clog` similar to `cerr` but with full buffering  \n  \n Objects are rarely constructed from `ostream`; predefined objects are generally used. In some cases, you can reassign predefined objects after program startup. The `ostream` class, which can be configured for buffered or unbuffered operation, is best suited to sequential text-mode output. All functionality of the base class, `ios`, is included in `ostream`. If you construct an object of class `ostream`, you must specify a `streambuf` object to the constructor.  \n  \n The `ofstream` class supports disk file output. If you need an output-only disk, construct an object of class `ofstream`. You can specify whether `ofstream` objects accept binary or text-mode data when constructing the `ofstream` object or when calling the `open` member function of the object. Many formatting options and member functions apply to `ofstream` objects, and all functionality of the base classes `ios` and `ostream` is included.  \n  \n If you specify a filename in the constructor, that file is automatically opened when the object is constructed. Otherwise, you can use the `open` member function after invoking the default constructor.  \n  \n Like the run-time function `sprintf_s`, the `ostringstream` class supports output to in-memory strings. To create a string in memory by using I/O stream formatting, construct an object of class `ostringstream`.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Constructing Output Stream Objects](../standard-library/constructing-output-stream-objects.md)  \n  \n [Using Insertion Operators and Controlling Format](../standard-library/using-insertion-operators-and-controlling-format.md)  \n  \n [Output File Stream Member Functions](../standard-library/output-file-stream-member-functions.md)  \n  \n [Effects of Buffering](../standard-library/effects-of-buffering.md)  \n  \n [Binary Output Files](../standard-library/binary-output-files.md)  \n  \n [Overloading the << Operator for Your Own Classes](../standard-library/overloading-the-output-operator-for-your-own-classes.md)  \n  \n [Writing Your Own Manipulators Without Arguments](../standard-library/writing-your-own-manipulators-without-arguments.md)  \n  \n## See Also \n [ofstream](../standard-library/basic-ofstream-class.md)   \n [ostringstream](../standard-library/basic-ostringstream-class.md)   \n [iostream Programming](../standard-library/iostream-programming.md)\n\n"}
