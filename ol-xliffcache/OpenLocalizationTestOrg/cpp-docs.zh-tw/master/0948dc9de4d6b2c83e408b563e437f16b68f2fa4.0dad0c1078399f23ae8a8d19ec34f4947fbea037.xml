The linker warns about this kind of export is because it could result in a larger image. This could happen if the range of your ordinal exports is large with relatively few exports. For example,  \n  \n```  \nEXPORTS  \n   DllGetClassObject   @1  \n   MyOtherAPI      @100  \n```  \n  \n will require 100 slots in the export address table with 98 of them (2-99) just filler. On the other hand,  \n  \n```  \nEXPORTS  \n   DllGetClassObject  \n   MyOtherAPI      @100  \n```  \n  \n will require two slots. (Be aware that you can also export with the [/EXPORT](../../build/reference/export-exports-a-function.md) linker option.)"}
