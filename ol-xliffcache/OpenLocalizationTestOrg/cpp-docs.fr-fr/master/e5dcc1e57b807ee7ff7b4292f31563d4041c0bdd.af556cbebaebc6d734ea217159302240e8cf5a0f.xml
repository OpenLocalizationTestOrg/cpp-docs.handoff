This is inconvenient when a text field contains multiple words or when commas separate numbers. In such a case, one alternative is to use the unformatted input member function [istream::getline](../standard-library/basic-istream-class.md#basic_istream__getline) to read a block of text with white space included, then parse the block with special functions. Another method is to derive an input stream class with a member function such as `GetNextToken`, which can call istream members to extract and format character data.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Input Streams](../standard-library/input-streams.md)\n\n"}
