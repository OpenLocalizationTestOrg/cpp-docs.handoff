Different languages and locales may use different code pages. For example, ANSI code page 1252 is used for English and most European languages; OEM code page 932 is used for Japanese Kanji.  \n  \n A code page can be represented in a table as a mapping of characters to single-byte values or multibyte values. Many code pages share the ASCII character set for characters in the range 0x00 – 0x7F.  \n  \n The Microsoft run-time library uses the following types of code pages:  \n  \n-   System-default ANSI code page. By default, at startup the run-time system automatically sets the multibyte code page to the system-default ANSI code page, which is obtained from the operating system. The call:  \n  \n    ```  \n    setlocale ( LC_ALL, \"\" );  \n    ```  \n  \n     also sets the locale to the system-default ANSI code page.  \n  \n-   Locale code page. The behavior of a number of run-time routines is dependent on the current locale setting, which includes the locale code page. (For more information, see [Locale-Dependent Routines](../c-runtime-library/locale.md).) By default, all locale-dependent routines in the Microsoft run-time library use the code page that corresponds to the \"C\" locale. At run-time you can change or query the locale code page in use with a call to [setlocale](../c-runtime-library/reference/setlocale-wsetlocale.md).  \n  \n-   Multibyte code page. The behavior of most of the multibyte-character routines in the run-time library depends on the current multibyte code page setting. By default, these routines use the system-default ANSI code page. At run-time you can query and change the multibyte code page with [_getmbcp](../c-runtime-library/reference/getmbcp.md) and [_setmbcp](../c-runtime-library/reference/setmbcp.md), respectively.  \n  \n-   The \"C\" locale is defined by ANSI to correspond to the locale in which C programs have traditionally executed. The code page for the \"C\" locale (\"C\" code page) corresponds to the ASCII character set. For example, in the \"C\" locale, `islower` returns true for the values 0x61 – 0x7A only. In another locale, `islower` may return true for these as well as other values, as defined by that locale.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Internationalization](../c-runtime-library/internationalization.md)   \n [Run-Time Routines by Category](../c-runtime-library/run-time-routines-by-category.md)"}
