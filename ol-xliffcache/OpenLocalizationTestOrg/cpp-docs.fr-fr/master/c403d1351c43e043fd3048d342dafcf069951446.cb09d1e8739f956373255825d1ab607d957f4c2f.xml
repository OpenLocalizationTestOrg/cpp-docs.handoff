MFC DLL is a binary file that acts as a shared library of functions that can be used simultaneously by multiple applications. The easiest way to create an MFC DLL project is to use the MFC DLL Wizard.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The appearance of features in the IDE can depend on your active settings or edition, and might differ from those described in Help. To change your settings, choose **Import and Export Settings** on the **Tools** menu. For more information, see [Customizing Development Settings in Visual Studio](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/22c4debb-4e31-47a8-8f19-16f328d7dcd3).  \n  \n### To create an MFC DLL Project using the MFC DLL Wizard  \n  \n1.  Follow the instructions in the help topic [Creating a Project with a Visual C++ Application Wizard](../../ide/creating-desktop-projects-by-using-application-wizards.md).  \n  \n **Note** In the **New Project** dialog box, select the `MFC DLL` icon in the Templates pane to open the MFC DLL Wizard.  \n  \n1.  Define your application settings using the [application settings](../../mfc/reference/application-settings-mfc-dll-wizard.md) page of the [MFC DLL Wizard](../../mfc/reference/mfc-dll-wizard.md).  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  Skip this step to keep the wizard default settings.  \n  \n2.  Click **Finish** to close the wizard and open your new project in **Solution Explorer**.  \n  \n Once your project is created, you can view the files created in the Solution Explorer. For more information about the files the wizard creates for your project, see the project-generated file ReadMe.txt. For more information about the file types, see [File Types Created for Visual C++ Projects](../../ide/file-types-created-for-visual-cpp-projects.md).  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Visual C++ Project Types](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/912b4ba2-7719-43d5-b087-db33e3f9329a)   \n [Adding Functionality with Code Wizards](../../ide/adding-functionality-with-code-wizards-cpp.md)   \n [Property Pages](../../ide/property-pages-visual-cpp.md)   \n [Deploying Applications](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/4ff8881d-0daf-47e7-bfe7-774c625031b4)\n\n"}
