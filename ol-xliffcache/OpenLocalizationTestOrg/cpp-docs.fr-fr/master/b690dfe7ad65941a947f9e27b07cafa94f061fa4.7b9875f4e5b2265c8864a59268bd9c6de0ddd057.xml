Any filename can include a full or partial path. A full path includes a drive name and one or more directory names. CL accepts filenames separated either by backslashes (\\\\) or forward slashes (/). Filenames that contain spaces must be surrounded by double quote characters. A partial path omits the drive name, which CL assumes to be the current drive. If you don't specify a path, CL assumes the file is in the current directory.  \n  \n The filename extension determines how files are processed. C and C++ files, which have the extension .c, .cxx, or .cpp, are compiled. Other files, including .obj files, libraries (.lib), and module-definition (.def) files, are passed to the linker without being processed.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Compiler Command-Line Syntax](../../build/reference/compiler-command-line-syntax.md)"}
