You can also use the Accelerator editor to modify the accelerator properties in the accelerator table. Changes made using the Properties window or the Accelerator editor have the same result: edits are immediately reflected in the accelerator table.  \n  \n There are three properties for each accelerator [ID](https://www.microsoftonedoc.com/#/organizations/e6f6a65cf14f462597b64ac058dbe1d0/projects/3fedad16-eaf1-41a6-8f96-0c1949c68f32/containers/a3daf831-1c5f-4bbe-964d-503870caf874/tocpaths/3487f185-de96-4b1d-87db-034a52223160/locales/en-US):  \n  \n-   The [Modifier property](../windows/accelerator-modifier-property.md) sets control key combinations for the accelerator.  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  In the Properties window, this property appears as three separate Boolean properties, all of which can be controlled independently: Alt, Ctrl, and Shift.  \n  \n-   The [Key property](../windows/accelerator-key-property.md) sets the actual key to use as the accelerator.  \n  \n-   The [Type property](../windows/accelerator-type-property.md) determines whether the key is interpreted as virtual (VIRTKEY) or ASCII/ANSI.  \n  \n For information on adding resources to managed projects, please see [Resources in Applications](http://msdn.microsoft.com/Library/8ad495d4-2941-40cf-bf64-e82e85825890) in the *.NET Framework Developer's Guide.* For information on manually adding resource files to managed projects, accessing resources, displaying static resources, and assigning resources strings to properties, see [Walkthrough: Using Resources for Localization with ASP.NET](http://msdn.microsoft.com/Library/bb4e5b44-e2b0-48ab-bbe9-609fb33900b6).  \n  \n## Requirements  \n Win32  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Predefined Accelerator Keys](../windows/predefined-accelerator-keys.md)   \n [Resource Editors](../mfc/resource-editors.md)   \n [Accelerator Editor](../mfc/accelerator-editor.md)"}
