The syntax of the **single** directive is as follows:  \n  \n```  \n#pragma omp single [clause[[,] clause] ...] new-linestructured-block  \n```  \n  \n The clause is one of the following:  \n  \n **private(** *variable-list* **)**  \n  \n **firstprivate(** *variable-list* **)**  \n  \n **copyprivate(** *variable-list* **)**  \n  \n **nowait**  \n  \n There is an implicit barrier after the **single** construct unless a **nowait** clause is specified.  \n  \n Restrictions to the **single** directive are as follows:  \n  \n-   Only a single **nowait** clause can appear on a **single** directive.  \n  \n-   The **copyprivate** clause must not be used with the **nowait** clause.  \n  \n## Cross References:  \n  \n-   **private**, **firstprivate**, and **copyprivate** clauses, see [Section 2.7.2](../../parallel/openmp/2-7-2-data-sharing-attribute-clauses.md) on page 25."}
