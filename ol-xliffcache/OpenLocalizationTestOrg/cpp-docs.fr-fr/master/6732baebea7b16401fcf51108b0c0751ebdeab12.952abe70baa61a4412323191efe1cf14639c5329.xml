When the user presses a thread-specific hot key, Windows posts a [WM_HOTKEY](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms646279) message to the beginning of a particular thread's message queue. The **WM_HOTKEY** message contains the virtual key code, shift state, and user-defined ID of the specific hot key that was pressed. For a list of standard virtual key codes, see Winuser.h. For more information on this method, see [RegisterHotKey](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms646309).  \n  \n Note that the shift state flags used in the call to **RegisterHotKey** are not the same as those returned by the [GetHotKey](../mfc/reference/chotkeyctrl-class.md#chotkeyctrl__gethotkey) member function; you'll have to translate these flags before calling **RegisterHotKey**.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Using CHotKeyCtrl](../mfc/using-chotkeyctrl.md)   \n [Controls](../mfc/controls-mfc.md)\n\n"}
