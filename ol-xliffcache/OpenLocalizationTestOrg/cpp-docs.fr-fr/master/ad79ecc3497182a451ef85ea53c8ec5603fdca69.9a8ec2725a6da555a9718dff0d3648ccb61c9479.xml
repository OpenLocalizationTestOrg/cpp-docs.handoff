\n### Remarks  \n This operator transfers the associated asynchronous state from `Other`. After the transfer, `Other` is *empty*.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"promise__promise_constructor\"></a>  promise::promise Constructor  \n Constructs a `promise` object.  \n  \n```\npromise();\ntemplate <class Alloc>\npromise(allocator_arg_t, const Alloc& Al);\npromise(promise&& Other) noexcept;\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `Al`  \n A memory allocator. See [\\<allocators>](../standard-library/allocators-header.md) for more information.  \n  \n `Other`  \n A `promise` object.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The first constructor constructs an *empty*`promise` object.  \n  \n The second constructor constructs an empty `promise` object and uses `Al` for memory allocation.  \n  \n The third constructor constructs a `promise` object and transfers the associated asynchronous state from `Other`, and leaves `Other` empty.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"promise__set_exception_method\"></a>  promise::set_exception  \n Atomically stores an exception as the result of this `promise` object and sets the *associated asynchronous state* to *ready*.  \n  \n```\nvoid set_exception(exception_ptr Exc);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `Exc`  \n An [exception_ptr](../standard-library/exception-typedefs.md#exception_ptr) that's stored by this method as the exception result.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n If the `promise` object has no associated asynchronous state, this method throws a [future_error](../standard-library/future-error-class.md) that has an error code of `no_state`.  \n  \n If `set_exception`, [set_exception_at_thread_exit](#promise__set_exception_at_thread_exit_method), [set_value](#promise__set_value_method), or [set_value_at_thread_exit](#promise__set_value_at_thread_exit_method) has already been called for a `promise` object that has the same associated asynchronous state, this method throws a `future_error` that has an error code of `promise_already_satisfied`.  \n  \n As a result of this method, any threads that are blocked on the associated asynchronous state become unblocked.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"promise__set_exception_at_thread_exit_method\"></a>  promise::set_exception_at_thread_exit  \n Atomically sets the result of this `promise` to indicate an exception, delivering the notification only after all thread-local objects in the current thread have been destroyed (usually at thread exit).  \n  \n```\nvoid set_exception_at_thread_exit(exception_ptr Exc);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `Exc`  \n An [exception_ptr](../standard-library/exception-typedefs.md#exception_ptr) that's stored by this method as the exception result.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n If the promise object has no *associated asynchronous state*, this method throws a [future_error](../standard-library/future-error-class.md) that has an error code of `no_state`.  \n  \n If [set_exception](#promise__set_exception_method), `set_exception_at_thread_exit`, [set_value](#promise__set_value_method), or [set_value_at_thread_exit](#promise__set_value_at_thread_exit_method) has already been called for a `promise` object that has the same associated asynchronous state, this method throws a `future_error` that has an error code of `promise_already_satisfied`.  \n  \n In contrast to [set_exception](#promise__set_exception_method), this method does not set the associated asynchronous state to ready until after all thread-local objects in the current thread have been destroyed. Typically, threads that are blocked on the associated asynchronous state are not unblocked until the current thread exits.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"promise__set_value_method\"></a>  promise::set_value  \n Atomically stores a value as the result of this `promise` object and sets the *associated asynchronous state* to *ready*.  \n  \n```\nvoid promise::set_value(const Ty& Val);\nvoid promise::set_value(Ty&& Val);\nvoid promise<Ty&>::set_value(Ty& Val);\nvoid promise<void>::set_value();\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `Val`  \n The value to be stored as the result.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n If the `promise` object has no associated asynchronous state, this method throws a [future_error](../standard-library/future-error-class.md) that has an error code of `no_state`.  \n  \n If [set_exception](#promise__set_exception_method), [set_exception_at_thread_exit](#promise__set_exception_at_thread_exit_method), `set_value`, or [set_value_at_thread_exit](#promise__set_value_at_thread_exit_method) has already been called for a `promise` object that has the same associated asynchronous state, this method throws a `future_error` that has an error code of `promise_already_satisfied`.  \n  \n As a result of this method, any threads that are blocked on the associated asynchronous state become unblocked.  \n  \n The first method also throws any exception that is thrown when `Val` is copied into the associated asynchronous state. In this situation, the associated asynchronous state is not set to ready.  \n  \n The second method also throws any exception that is thrown when `Val` is moved into the associated asynchronous state. In this situation, the associated asynchronous state is not set to ready.  \n  \n For the partial specialization `promise<Ty&>`, the stored value is in effect a reference to `Val`.  \n  \n For the specialization `promise<void>`, no stored value exists.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"promise__set_value_at_thread_exit_method\"></a>  promise::set_value_at_thread_exit  \n Atomically stores a value as the result of this `promise` object.  \n  \n```\nvoid promise::set_value_at_thread_exit(const Ty& Val);\nvoid promise::set_value_at_thread_exit(Ty&& Val);\nvoid promise<Ty&>::set_value_at_thread_exit(Ty& Val);\nvoid promise<void>::set_value_at_thread_exit();\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `Val`  \n The value to be stored as the result.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n If the promise object has no *associated asynchronous state*, this method throws a [future_error](../standard-library/future-error-class.md) that has an error code of `no_state`.  \n  \n If [set_exception](#promise__set_exception_method), [set_exception_at_thread_exit](#promise__set_exception_at_thread_exit_method), [set_value](#promise__set_value_method), or `set_value_at_thread_exit` has already been called for a `promise` object that has the same associated asynchronous state, this method throws a `future_error` that has an error code of `promise_already_satisfied`.  \n  \n In contrast to `set_value`, the associated asynchronous state is not set to ready until after all thread-local objects in the current thread have been destroyed. Typically, threads that are blocked on the associated asynchronous state are not unblocked until the current thread exits.  \n  \n The first method also throws any exception that is thrown when `Val` is copied into the associated asynchronous state.  \n  \n The second method also throws any exception that is thrown when `Val` is moved into the associated asynchronous state.  \n  \n For the partial specialization `promise<Ty&>`, the stored value is effectively a reference to `Val`.  \n  \n For the specialization `promise<void>`, no stored value exists.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"promise__swap_method\"></a>  promise::swap  \n Exchanges the *associated asynchronous state* of this promise object with that of a specified object.  \n  \n```\nvoid swap(promise& Other) noexcept;\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `Other`  \n A `promise` object.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Header Files Reference](../standard-library/cpp-standard-library-header-files.md)\n\n\n\n\n \n\n"}
