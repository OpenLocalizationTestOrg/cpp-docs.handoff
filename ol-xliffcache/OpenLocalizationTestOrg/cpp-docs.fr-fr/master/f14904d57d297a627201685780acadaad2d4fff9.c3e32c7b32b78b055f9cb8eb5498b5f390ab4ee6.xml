The values for control types are as follows:  \n  \n- **ODT_COMBOBOX** Owner-draw combo box  \n  \n- **ODT_LISTBOX** Owner-draw list box  \n  \n- **ODT_MENU** Owner-draw menu  \n  \n `CtlID`  \n Contains the control ID for a combo box, list box, or button. This member is not used for a menu.  \n  \n `itemID`  \n Contains the menu-item ID for a menu or the list-box-item ID for a variable-height combo box or list box. This member is not used for a fixed-height combo box or list box, or for a button.  \n  \n *itemWidth*  \n Specifies the width of a menu item. The owner of the owner-draw menu item must fill this member before it returns from the message.  \n  \n *itemHeight*  \n Specifies the height of an individual item in a list box or a menu. Before it returns from the message, the owner of the owner-draw combo box, list box, or menu item must fill out this member. The maximum height of a list box item is 255.  \n  \n `itemData`  \n For a combo box or list box, this member contains the value that was passed to the list box by one of the following:  \n  \n- [CComboBox::AddString](../../mfc/reference/ccombobox-class.md#ccombobox__addstring)  \n  \n- [CComboBox::InsertString](../../mfc/reference/ccombobox-class.md#ccombobox__insertstring)  \n  \n- [CListBox::AddString](../../mfc/reference/clistbox-class.md#clistbox__addstring)  \n  \n- [CListBox::InsertString](../../mfc/reference/clistbox-class.md#clistbox__insertstring)  \n  \n For a menu, this member contains the value that was passed to the menu by one of the following:  \n  \n- [CMenu::AppendMenu](../../mfc/reference/cmenu-class.md#cmenu__appendmenu)  \n  \n- [CMenu::InsertMenu](../../mfc/reference/cmenu-class.md#cmenu__insertmenu)  \n  \n- [CMenu::ModifyMenu](../../mfc/reference/cmenu-class.md#cmenu__modifymenu)  \n  \n This allows Windows to process user interaction with the control correctly. Failure to fill out the proper members in the `MEASUREITEMSTRUCT` structure will cause improper operation of the control.  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Header:** winuser.h  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Structures, Styles, Callbacks, and Message Maps](../../mfc/reference/structures-styles-callbacks-and-message-maps.md)   \n [CWnd::OnMeasureItem](../../mfc/reference/cwnd-class.md#cwnd__onmeasureitem)\n\n"}
