# Ready-to-Use Map Classes
The following classes are ready-to-use map classes.  
  
 [CMapPtrToPtr](../mfc/reference/cmapptrtoptr-class.md)  
 Uses `void` pointers as keys for finding other `void` pointers.  
  
 [CMapPtrToWord](../mfc/reference/cmapptrtoword-class.md)  
 Uses `void` pointers as keys for finding data of type **WORD**.  
  
 [CMapStringToOb](../mfc/reference/cmapstringtoob-class.md)  
 Uses `CString` objects as keys for finding `CObject` pointers.  
  
 [CMapStringToPtr](../mfc/reference/cmapstringtoptr-class.md)  
 Uses `CString` objects as keys for finding `void` pointers.  
  
 [CMapStringToString](../mfc/reference/cmapstringtostring-class.md)  
 Uses `CString` objects as keys for finding other `CString` objects.  
  
 [CMapWordToOb](../mfc/reference/cmapwordtoob-class.md)  
 Uses data of type **WORD** to find `CObject` pointers.  
  
 [CMapWordToPtr](../mfc/reference/cmapwordtoptr-class.md)
