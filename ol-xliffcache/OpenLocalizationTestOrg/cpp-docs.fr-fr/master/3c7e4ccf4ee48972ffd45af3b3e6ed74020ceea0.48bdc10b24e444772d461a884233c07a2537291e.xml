Because thousands of applications use the C-language Windows application programming interface (API), that interface will be maintained for the foreseeable future. Any C++ Windows interface must therefore be built on top of the procedural C-language API. This guarantees that C++ applications will be able to coexist with C applications.  \n  \n The Microsoft Foundation Class Library is an object-oriented interface to Windows that meets the following design goals:  \n  \n-   Significant reduction in the effort to write an application for Windows.  \n  \n-   Execution speed comparable to that of the C-language API.  \n  \n-   Minimum code size overhead.  \n  \n-   Ability to call any Windows C function directly.  \n  \n-   Easier conversion of existing C applications to C++.  \n  \n-   Ability to leverage from the existing base of C-language Windows programming experience.  \n  \n-   Easier use of the Windows API with C++ than with C.  \n  \n-   Easier to use yet powerful abstractions of complicated features such as ActiveX controls, database support, printing, toolbars, and status bars.  \n  \n-   True Windows API for C++ that effectively uses C++ language features.  \n  \n For more on the design of the MFC Library, see:  \n  \n-   [The Application Framework](../mfc/application-framework.md)  \n  \n-   [Relationship to the C-Language API](../mfc/relationship-to-the-c-language-api.md)  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Class Overview](../mfc/class-library-overview.md)\n\n"}
