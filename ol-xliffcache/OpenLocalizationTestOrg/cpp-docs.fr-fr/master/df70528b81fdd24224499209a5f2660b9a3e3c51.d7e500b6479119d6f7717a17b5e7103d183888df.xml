from a collection in which the each element is a pair that has both a data value and a sort key. The value of the key does not need to be unique and is used to order the data automatically. The value of an element in a multimap, but not its associated key value, may be changed directly. Instead, key values associated with old elements must be deleted and new key values associated with new elements inserted.  \n  \n## Syntax  \n  \n```  \ntemplate <class Key,   \n    class Type,   \n    class Traits=less <Key>,   \n    class Allocator=allocator <pair  <const Key, Type>>>  \nclass multimap;  \n```  \n  \n#### Parameters  \n `Key`  \n The key data type to be stored in the multimap.  \n  \n `Type`  \n The element data type to be stored in the multimap.  \n  \n `Traits`  \n The type that provides a function object that can compare two element values as sort keys to determine their relative order in the multimap. The binary predicate `less<Key>` is the default value.  \n  \n In C++14 you can enable heterogeneous lookup by specifying the `std::less<>` or `std::greater<>` predicate that has no type parameters. For more information, see [Heterogeneous Lookup in Associative Containers](../standard-library/stl-containers.md#sequence_containers)  \n  \n `Allocator`  \n The type that represents the stored allocator object that encapsulates details about the map's allocation and deallocation of memory. This argument is optional and the default value is `allocator<pair <const Key, Type> >`.  \n  \n## Remarks  \n The STL multimap class is  \n  \n-   An associative container, which a variable size container that supports the efficient retrieval of element values based on an associated key value.  \n  \n-   Reversible, because it provides bidirectional iterators to access its elements.  \n  \n-   Sorted, because its elements are ordered by key values within the container in accordance with a specified comparison function.  \n  \n-   Multiple, because its elements do not need to have a unique keys, so that one key value may have many element data values associated with it.  \n  \n-   A pair associative container, because its element data values are distinct from its key values.  \n  \n-   A template class, because the functionality it provides is generic and so independent of the specific type of data contained as elements or keys. The data types to be used for elements and keys are, instead, specified as parameters in the class template along with the comparison function and allocator.  \n  \n The iterator provided by the map class is a bidirectional iterator, but the class member functions [insert](#multimap__insert) and [multimap](#multimap__multimap) have versions that take as template parameters a weaker input iterator, whose functionality requirements are more minimal than those guaranteed by the class of bidirectional iterators. The different iterator concepts form a family related by refinements in their functionality. Each iterator concept has its own set of requirements and the algorithms that work with them must limit their assumptions to the requirements provided by that type of iterator. It may be assumed that an input iterator may be dereferenced to refer to some object and that it may be incremented to the next iterator in the sequence. This is a minimal set of functionality, but it is enough to be able to talk meaningfully about a range of iterators `[First, Last)` in the context of the class's member functions.  \n  \n The choice of container type should be based in general on the type of searching and inserting required by the application. Associative containers are optimized for the operations of lookup, insertion and removal. The member functions that explicitly support these operations are efficient, performing them in a time that is on average proportional to the logarithm of the number of elements in the container. Inserting elements invalidates no iterators, and removing elements invalidates only those iterators that had specifically pointed at the removed elements.  \n  \n The multimap should be the associative container of choice when the conditions associating the values with their keys are satisfied by the application. A model for this type of structure is an ordered list of key words with associated string values providing, say, definitions, where the words were not always uniquely defined. If, instead, the key words were uniquely defined so that keys were unique, then a map would be the container of choice. If, on the other hand, just the list of words were being stored, then a set would be the correct container. If multiple occurrences of the words were allowed, then a multiset would be the appropriate container structure.  \n  \n The multimap orders the sequence it controls by calling a stored function object of type [key_compare](#multimap__key_compare). This stored object is a comparison function that may be accessed by calling the member function [key_comp](#multimap__key_comp). In general, the elements need be merely less than comparable to establish this order: so that, given any two elements, it may be determined either that they are equivalent (in the sense that neither is less than the other) or that one is less than the other. This results in an ordering between the nonequivalent elements. On a more technical note, the comparison function is a binary predicate that induces a strict weak ordering in the standard mathematical sense. A binary predicate `f(x,y)` is a function object that has two argument objects `x` and `y` and a return value of true or false. An ordering imposed on a set is a strict weak ordering if the binary predicate is irreflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive and if equivalence is transitive, where two objects `x` and `y` are defined to be equivalent when both `f(x,y)` and `f(y,x)` are false. If the stronger condition of equality between keys replaces that of equivalence, then the ordering becomes total (in the sense that all the elements are ordered with respect to each other) and the keys matched will be indiscernible from each other.  \n  \n In C++14 you can enable heterogeneous lookup by specifying the `std::less<>` or `std::greater<>` predicate that has no type parameters.

During the insertion of multiple elements, if an exception is thrown, the container is left in an unspecified but valid state.  \n  \n The [value_type](../standard-library/map-class.md#map__value_type) of a container is a typedef that belongs to the container, and for map, `multimap<K, V>::value_type` is `pair<const K, V>`. The value of an element is an ordered pair in which the first component is equal to the key value and the second component is equal to the data value of the element.  \n  \n The range member function (5) inserts the sequence of element values into a multimap that corresponds to each element addressed by an iterator in the range `[First, Last)`; therefore, `Last` does not get inserted. The container member function `end()` refers to the position just after the last element in the container—for example, the statement `m.insert(v.begin(), v.end());` inserts all elements of `v` into `m`.  \n  \n The initializer list member function (6) uses an [initializer_list](../standard-library/initializer-list.md) to copy elements into the map.  \n  \n For insertion of an element constructed in place—that is, no copy or move operations are performed—see [multimap::emplace](#multimap__emplace) and [multimap::emplace_hint](#multimap__emplace_hint).  \n  \n### Example  \n  \n```cpp  \n  \n// multimap_insert.cpp  \n// compile with: /EHsc  \n#include <map>  \n#include <iostream>  \n#include <string>  \n#include <vector>  \n#include <utility>  // make_pair()  \n  \nusing namespace std;  \n  \ntemplate <typename M> void print(const M& m) {  \n    cout << m.size() << \" elements: \";  \n  \n    for (const auto& p : m) {  \n        cout << \"(\" << p.first << \", \" << p.second << \") \";  \n    }  \n  \n    cout << endl;  \n}  \n  \nint main()  \n{  \n  \n    // insert single values   \n    multimap<int, int> m1;  \n    // call insert(const value_type&) version  \n    m1.insert({ 1, 10 });  \n    // call insert(ValTy&&) version   \n    m1.insert(make_pair(2, 20));  \n  \n    cout << \"The original key and mapped values of m1 are:\" << endl;  \n    print(m1);  \n  \n    // intentionally attempt a duplicate, single element  \n    m1.insert(make_pair(1, 111));  \n  \n    cout << \"The modified key and mapped values of m1 are:\" << endl;  \n    print(m1);  \n  \n    // single element, with hint  \n    m1.insert(m1.end(), make_pair(3, 30));  \n    cout << \"The modified key and mapped values of m1 are:\" << endl;  \n    print(m1);  \n    cout << endl;  \n  \n    // The templatized version inserting a jumbled range  \n    multimap<int, int> m2;  \n    vector<pair<int, int>> v;  \n    v.push_back(make_pair(43, 294));  \n    v.push_back(make_pair(41, 262));  \n    v.push_back(make_pair(45, 330));  \n    v.push_back(make_pair(42, 277));  \n    v.push_back(make_pair(44, 311));  \n  \n    cout << \"Inserting the following vector data into m2:\" << endl;  \n    print(v);  \n  \n    m2.insert(v.begin(), v.end());  \n  \n    cout << \"The modified key and mapped values of m2 are:\" << endl;  \n    print(m2);  \n    cout << endl;  \n  \n    // The templatized versions move-constructing elements  \n    multimap<int, string>  m3;  \n    pair<int, string> ip1(475, \"blue\"), ip2(510, \"green\");  \n  \n    // single element  \n    m3.insert(move(ip1));  \n    cout << \"After the first move insertion, m3 contains:\" << endl;  \n    print(m3);  \n  \n    // single element with hint  \n    m3.insert(m3.end(), move(ip2));  \n    cout << \"After the second move insertion, m3 contains:\" << endl;  \n    print(m3);  \n    cout << endl;  \n  \n    multimap<int, int> m4;  \n    // Insert the elements from an initializer_list  \n    m4.insert({ { 4, 44 }, { 2, 22 }, { 3, 33 }, { 1, 11 }, { 5, 55 } });  \n    cout << \"After initializer_list insertion, m4 contains:\" << endl;  \n    print(m4);  \n    cout << endl;  \n}  \n  \n```  \n  \n##  <a name=\"multimap__iterator\"></a>  multimap::iterator  \n A type that provides a bidirectional iterator that can read or modify any element in a multimap.  \n  \n```  \ntypedef implementation-defined iterator;  \n```  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The **iterator** defined by multimap points to objects of [value_type](#multimap__value_type), which are of type `pair`*\\<***const Key**, **Type***>*. The value of the key is available through the first member pair and the value of the mapped element is available through the second member of the pair.  \n  \n To dereference an **iterator**`Iter` pointing to an element in a multimap, use the **->** operator.  \n  \n To access the value of the key for the element, use `Iter` -> **first**, which is equivalent to (\\* `Iter`). **first**. To access the value of the mapped datum for the element, use `Iter` -> **second**, which is equivalent to (\\* `Iter`). **second**.  \n  \n A type **iterator** can be used to modify the value of an element.  \n  \n### Example  \n  See the example for [begin](#multimap__begin) for an example of how to declare and use **iterator**.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"multimap__key_comp\"></a>  multimap::key_comp  \n Retrieves a copy of the comparison object used to order keys in a multimap.  \n  \n```  \nkey_compare key_comp() const;\n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Returns the function object that a multimap uses to order its elements.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The stored object defines the member function  \n  \n **bool operator**( **const Key&** *x*, **const Key&** *y*);  \n  \n which returns true if *x* strictly precedes *y* in the sort order.  \n  \n### Example  \n  \n```cpp  \n// multimap_key_comp.cpp  \n// compile with: /EHsc  \n#include <map>  \n#include <iostream>  \n  \nint main( )  \n{  \n   using namespace std;  \n  \n   multimap <int, int, less<int> > m1;  \n   multimap <int, int, less<int> >::key_compare kc1 = m1.key_comp( ) ;  \n   bool result1 = kc1( 2, 3 ) ;  \n   if( result1 == true )     \n   {  \n      cout << \"kc1( 2,3 ) returns value of true, \"  \n           << \"where kc1 is the function object of m1.\"  \n           << endl;  \n   }  \n   else     \n   {  \n      cout << \"kc1( 2,3 ) returns value of false \"  \n           << \"where kc1 is the function object of m1.\"  \n           << endl;  \n   }  \n  \n   multimap <int, int, greater<int> > m2;  \n   multimap <int, int, greater<int> >::key_compare kc2 = m2.key_comp( );  \n   bool result2 = kc2( 2, 3 ) ;  \n   if( result2 == true )     \n   {  \n      cout << \"kc2( 2,3 ) returns value of true, \"  \n           << \"where kc2 is the function object of m2.\"  \n           << endl;  \n   }  \n   else     \n   {  \n      cout << \"kc2( 2,3 ) returns value of false, \"  \n           << \"where kc2 is the function object of m2.\"  \n           << endl;  \n   }  \n}  \n```  \n  \n```Output  \nkc1( 2,3 ) returns value of true, where kc1 is the function object of m1.  \nkc2( 2,3 ) returns value of false, where kc2 is the function object of m2.  \n```  \n  \n##  <a name=\"multimap__key_compare\"></a>  multimap::key_compare  \n A type that provides a function object that can compare two sort keys to determine the relative order of two elements in the multimap.  \n  \n```  \ntypedef Traits key_compare;  \n```  \n  \n### Remarks  \n **key_compare** is a synonym for the template parameter `Traits`.  \n  \n For more information on `Traits` see the [multimap Class](../standard-library/multimap-class.md) topic.  \n  \n### Example  \n  See the example for [key_comp](#multimap__key_comp) for an example of how to declare and use `key_compare`.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"multimap__key_type\"></a>  multimap::key_type  \n A type that describes the sort key object that constitutes each element of the multimap.  \n  \n```  \ntypedef Key key_type;  \n```  \n  \n### Remarks  \n **key_type** is a synonym for the template parameter `Key`.  \n  \n For more information on `Key`, see the Remarks section of the [multimap Class](../standard-library/multimap-class.md) topic.  \n  \n### Example  \n  See the example for [value_type](#multimap__value_type) for an example of how to declare and use `key_type`.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"multimap__lower_bound\"></a>  multimap::lower_bound  \n Returns an iterator to the first element in a multimap that with a key that is equal to or greater than a specified key.  \n  \n```  \niterator lower_bound(const Key& key);\n\nconst_iterator lower_bound(const Key& key) const;\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n ` key`  \n The argument key to be compared with the sort key of an element from the multimap being searched.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n An iterator or `const_iterator` that addresses the location of an element in a multimap that with a key that is equal to or greater than the argument key, or that addresses the location succeeding the last element in the multimap if no match is found for the key.  \n  \n If the return value of `lower_bound` is assigned to a `const_iterator`, the multimap object cannot be modified.
