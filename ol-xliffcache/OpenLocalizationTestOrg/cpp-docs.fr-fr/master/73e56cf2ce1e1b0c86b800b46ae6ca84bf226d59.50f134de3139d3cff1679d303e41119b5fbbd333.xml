The `Scheduler` object used is implied by the schedule group.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The runtime uses the default scheduler if you do not specify the `_PScheduler` or `_PScheduleGroup` parameters.  \n  \n The type `filter_method` is a functor with signature `bool (T const &)` which is invoked by this `overwrite_buffer` messaging block to determine whether or not it should accept an offered message.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"propagate_message\"></a>  overwrite_buffer::propagate_message Method  \n Asynchronously passes a message from an `ISource` block to this `overwrite_buffer` messaging block. It is invoked by the `propagate` method, when called by a source block.  \n  \n```\nvirtual message_status propagate_message(\n    _Inout_ message<T>* _PMessage,\n    _Inout_ ISource<T>* _PSource);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `_PMessage`  \n A pointer to the `message` object.  \n  \n `_PSource`  \n A pointer to the source block offering the message.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n A [message_status](concurrency-namespace-enums.md) indication of what the target decided to do with the message.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"propagate_to_any_targets\"></a>  overwrite_buffer::propagate_to_any_targets Method  \n Places the `message``_PMessage` in this `overwrite_buffer` messaging block and offers it to all of the linked targets.  \n  \n```\nvirtual void propagate_to_any_targets(_Inout_ message<T>* _PMessage);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `_PMessage`  \n A pointer to a `message` object that this `overwrite_buffer` has taken ownership of.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n This method overwrites the current message in the `overwrite_buffer` with the newly accepted message `_PMessage`.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"send_message\"></a>  overwrite_buffer::send_message Method  \n Synchronously passes a message from an `ISource` block to this `overwrite_buffer` messaging block. It is invoked by the `send` method, when called by a source block.  \n  \n```\nvirtual message_status send_message(\n    _Inout_ message<T>* _PMessage,\n    _Inout_ ISource<T>* _PSource);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `_PMessage`  \n A pointer to the `message` object.  \n  \n `_PSource`  \n A pointer to the source block offering the message.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n A [message_status](concurrency-namespace-enums.md) indication of what the target decided to do with the message.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"supports_anonymous_source\"></a>  overwrite_buffer::supports_anonymous_source Method  \n Overrides the `supports_anonymous_source` method to indicate that this block can accept messages offered to it by a source that is not linked.  \n  \n```\nvirtual bool supports_anonymous_source();\n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n `true` because the block does not postpone offered messages.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"release_message\"></a>  overwrite_buffer::release_message Method  \n Releases a previous message reservation.  \n  \n```\nvirtual void release_message(runtime_object_identity _MsgId);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `_MsgId`  \n The `runtime_object_identity` of the `message` object being released.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"reserve_message\"></a>  overwrite_buffer::reserve_message Method  \n Reserves a message previously offered by this `overwrite_buffer` messaging block.  \n  \n```\nvirtual bool reserve_message(runtime_object_identity _MsgId);\n```  \n  \n### Parameters  \n `_MsgId`  \n The `runtime_object_identity` of the `message` object being reserved.  \n  \n### Return Value  \n `true` if the message was successfully reserved, `false` otherwise.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n After `reserve` is called, if it returns `true`, either `consume` or `release` must be called to either take or release ownership of the message.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"resume_propagation\"></a>  overwrite_buffer::resume_propagation Method  \n Resumes propagation after a reservation has been released.  \n  \n```\nvirtual void resume_propagation();\n```  \n  \n##  <a name=\"value\"></a>  overwrite_buffer::value Method  \n Gets a reference to the current payload of the message being stored in the `overwrite_buffer` messaging block.  \n  \n```\nT value();\n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n The payload of the currently stored message.  \n  \n### Remarks  \n The value stored in the `overwrite_buffer` could change immediately after this method returns. This method will wait until a message arrives if no message is currently stored in the `overwrite_buffer`.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [concurrency Namespace](concurrency-namespace.md)   \n [unbounded_buffer Class](unbounded-buffer-class.md)   \n [single_assignment Class](single-assignment-class.md)\n"}
