During dynamic creation, the document constructor is called.  \n  \n2.  For each new document, the document's [OnNewDocument](../mfc/reference/cdocument-class.md#cdocument__onnewdocument) or [OnOpenDocument](../mfc/reference/cdocument-class.md#cdocument__onopendocument) is called.  \n  \n3.  The user interacts with the document throughout its lifetime. Typically this happens as the user works on document data through the view, selecting and editing the data. The view passes changes on to the document for storage and updating other views. During this time both the document and the view might handle commands.  \n  \n4.  The framework calls [DeleteContents](../mfc/reference/cdocument-class.md#cdocument__deletecontents) to delete data specific to a document.  \n  \n5.  The document's destructor is called.  \n  \n In an SDI application, step 1 is performed once, when the document is first created. Then steps 2 through 4 are performed repeatedly each time a new document is opened. The new document reuses the existing document object. Finally, step 5 is performed when the application ends.  \n  \n## What do you want to know more about  \n  \n-   [Initializing Documents and Views](../mfc/initializing-documents-and-views.md)  \n  \n-   [Cleaning Up Documents and Views](../mfc/cleaning-up-documents-and-views.md)  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Document/View Architecture](../mfc/document-view-architecture.md)\n\n"}
