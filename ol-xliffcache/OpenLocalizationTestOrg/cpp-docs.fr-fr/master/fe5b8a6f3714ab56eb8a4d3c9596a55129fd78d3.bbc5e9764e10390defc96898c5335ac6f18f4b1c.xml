In addition, the [CComSafeDeleteCriticalSection::Term](#ccomsafedeletecriticalsection__term) method will exit gracefully if the underlying critical section object has not yet been allocated or has already been released from memory.  \n  \n See [CComCriticalSection](../../atl/reference/ccomcriticalsection-class.md) for more information on critical section helper classes.  \n  \n## Inheritance Hierarchy  \n [CComCriticalSection](../../atl/reference/ccomcriticalsection-class.md)  \n  \n `CComSafeDeleteCriticalSection`  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Header:** atlcore.h  \n  \n##  <a name=\"ccomsafedeletecriticalsection__ccomsafedeletecriticalsection\"></a>  CComSafeDeleteCriticalSection::CComSafeDeleteCriticalSection  \n The constructor.  \n  \n```\nCComSafeDeleteCriticalSection();\n```  \n  \n### Remarks  \n Sets the [m_bInitialized](#ccomsafedeletecriticalsection__m_binitialized) data member to **false**.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"ccomsafedeletecriticalsection___dtorccomsafedeletecriticalsection\"></a>  CComSafeDeleteCriticalSection::~CComSafeDeleteCriticalSection  \n The destructor.  \n  \n```\n~CComSafeDeleteCriticalSection() throw();\n```  \n  \n### Remarks  \n Releases the internal **CRITICAL_SECTION** object from memory if the [m_bInitialized](#ccomsafedeletecriticalsection__m_binitialized) data member is set to **true**.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"ccomsafedeletecriticalsection__init\"></a>  CComSafeDeleteCriticalSection::Init  \n Calls the base class implementation of [Init](/visualstudio/debugger/init) and sets [m_bInitialized](#ccomsafedeletecriticalsection__m_binitialized) to **true** if successful.  \n  \n```\nHRESULT Init() throw();\n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Returns the result of [CComCriticalSection::Init](../../atl/reference/ccomcriticalsection-class.md#ccomcriticalsection__init).  \n  \n##  <a name=\"ccomsafedeletecriticalsection__lock\"></a>  CComSafeDeleteCriticalSection::Lock  \nCalls the base class implementation of [Lock](ccomcriticalsection-class.md#ccomcriticalsection__lock).  \n\n  \n```\nHRESULT Lock();\n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n Returns the result of [CComCriticalSection::Lock](../../atl/reference/ccomcriticalsection-class.md#ccomcriticalsection__lock).  \n  \n### Remarks  \n This method assumes the [m_bInitialized](#ccomsafedeletecriticalsection__m_binitialized) data member is set to **true** upon entry.
