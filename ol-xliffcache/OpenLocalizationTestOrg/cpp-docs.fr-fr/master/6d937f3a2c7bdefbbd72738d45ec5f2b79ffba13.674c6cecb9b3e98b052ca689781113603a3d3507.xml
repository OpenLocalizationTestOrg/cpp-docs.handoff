Each document usually has one \"document frame window.\" A document frame window contains at least one view, which presents the document's data.  \n  \n## Frame Windows in SDI and MDI Applications  \n For an SDI application, there is one frame window derived from class [CFrameWnd](../mfc/reference/cframewnd-class.md). This window is both the main frame window and the document frame window. For an MDI application, the main frame window is derived from class [CMDIFrameWnd](../mfc/reference/cmdiframewnd-class.md), and the document frame windows, which are MDI child windows, are derived from class [CMDIChildWnd](../mfc/reference/cmdichildwnd-class.md).  \n  \n## Use the Frame-Window Class, or Derive from It  \n These classes provide most of the frame-window functionality you need for your applications. Under normal circumstances, the default behavior and appearance they provide will suit your needs. If you need additional functionality, derive from these classes.  \n  \n### What do you want to know more about  \n  \n-   [Frame-window classes created by the Application Wizard](../mfc/frame-window-classes-created-by-the-application-wizard.md)  \n  \n-   [Frame-window styles](../mfc/frame-window-styles-cpp.md)  \n  \n-   [Changing the styles of a window created by MFC](../mfc/changing-the-styles-of-a-window-created-by-mfc.md)  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Frame Windows](../mfc/frame-windows.md)\n\n"}
