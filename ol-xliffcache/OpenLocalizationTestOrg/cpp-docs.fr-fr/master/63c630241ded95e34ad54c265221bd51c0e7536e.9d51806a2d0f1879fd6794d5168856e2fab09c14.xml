Its effect depends upon whether dynamic adjustment of the number of threads is enabled. For a comprehensive set of rules about the interaction between the **OMP_NUM_THREADS** environment variable and dynamic adjustment of threads, see Section 2.3 on page 8.  \n  \n If no value is specified for the **OMP_NUM_THREADS** environment variable, or if the value specified is not a positive integer, or if the value is greater than the maximum number of threads the system can support, the number of threads to use is implementation-defined.  \n  \n Example:  \n  \n```  \nsetenv OMP_NUM_THREADS 16  \n```  \n  \n## Cross References:  \n  \n-   **num_threads** clause, see [Section 2.3](../../parallel/openmp/2-3-parallel-construct.md) on page 8.  \n  \n-   **omp_set_num_threads** function, see [Section 3.1.1](../../parallel/openmp/3-1-1-omp-set-num-threads-function.md) on page 36.  \n  \n-   **omp_set_dynamic** function, see [Section 3.1.7](../../parallel/openmp/3-1-7-omp-set-dynamic-function.md) on page 39."}
