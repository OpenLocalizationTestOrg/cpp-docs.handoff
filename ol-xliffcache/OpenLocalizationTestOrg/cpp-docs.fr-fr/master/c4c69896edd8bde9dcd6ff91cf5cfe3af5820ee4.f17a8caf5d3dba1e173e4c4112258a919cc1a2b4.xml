db_source\nCreates a connection to a data source.  \n  \n## Syntax  \n  \n```  \n  \n      [ db_source(   \n   db_source,   \n   name,   \n   hresult   \n) ]  \n```  \n  \n#### Parameters  \n *db_source*  \n The connection string used to connect to the data source. For the format of the connection string, see [Connection Strings and Data Links](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms718376.aspx) in the Microsoft Data Access Components (MDAC) SDK.  \n  \n *name* (optional)  \n When you use `db_source` on a class, *name* is an instance of a data source object that has the `db_source` attribute applied to it (see example 1). When you use `db_source` inline in a method implementation, *name* is a variable (local to the method) that can be used to access the data source (see example 2). You pass this *name* to the `source_name` parameter of **db_command** to associate the data source with a command.  \n  \n `hresult` (optional)  \n Identifies the variable that will receive the `HRESULT` of this database command. If the variable does not exist, it will be automatically injected by the attribute.  \n  \n## Remarks  \n `db_source` creates a [CDataSource](../data/oledb/cdatasource-class.md) and a [CSession](../data/oledb/csession-class.md) object, which together represent a connection with an OLE DB consumer data source.  \n  \n When you use `db_source` on a class, the `CSession` object becomes a member of the class.  \n  \n When you use `db_source` in a method, the injected code will be executed within method scope, and the `CSession` object is created as a local variable.  \n  \n `db_source` adds data source properties to a class or within a method. It is used in conjunction with **db_command** (which takes the `db_source` *name* parameter as its `source_name` parameter).  \n  \n When the consumer attribute provider applies this attribute to a class, the compiler will rename the class to _*YourClassName*Accessor, where *YourClassName* is the name you gave the class, and the compiler will also create a class called *YourClassName,* which derives from \\_*YourClassName*Accessor.  In Class View, you will see both classes.  \n  \n For an example of this attribute used in an application, see the samples [AtlAgent](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/52bef5da-c1a0-4223-b4e6-9e464b6db409) and [MultiRead](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/5a2a915a-77dc-492f-94b2-1b809995dd5e).  \n  \n## Example  \n This sample calls `db_source` on a class to create a connection to the data source `ds` using the Northwind database. `ds` is a handle for the data source, which can be used internally to the `CMyCommand` class.  \n  \n```  \n// db_source_1.cpp  \n// compile with: /LD  \n#include <atlbase.h>  \n#include <atlplus.h>  \n#include <atldbcli.h>  \n  \n[  \n  db_source(L\"my_connection_string\", name=\"ds\"),  \n  db_command(L\"select * from Products\")  \n]  \nclass CMyCommand {};  \n```  \n  \n## Requirements  \n  \n### Attribute Context  \n  \n|||  \n|-|-|  \n|**Applies to**|**class**, `struct`, member, method, local|  \n|**Repeatable**|No|  \n|**Required attributes**|None|  \n|**Invalid attributes**|None|  \n  \n For more information about the attribute contexts, see [Attribute Contexts](../windows/attribute-contexts.md).  \n  \n## See Also  \n [OLE DB Consumer Attributes](../windows/ole-db-consumer-attributes.md)   \n [Attributes Samples](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/558ebdb2-082f-44dc-b442-d8d33bf7bdb8)"}
