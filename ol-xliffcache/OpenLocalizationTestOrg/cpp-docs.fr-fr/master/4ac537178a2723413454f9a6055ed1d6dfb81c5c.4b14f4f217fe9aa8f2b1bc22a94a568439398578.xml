Please rebuild this object  \n  \n When using [/LTCG](../../build/reference/ltcg-link-time-code-generation.md), the compiler detected a .pch file that is newer than a CIL .obj that points to it. The information in the CIL .obj file is out of date. Rebuild the object.  \n  \n C1382 can also occur if you compile with **/Yc**, but also pass multiple source code files to the compiler.  To resolve, do not use **/Yc** when passing multiple source code files to the compiler.  For more information, see [/Yc (Create Precompiled Header File)](../../build/reference/yc-create-precompiled-header-file.md)."}
