Open the accelerator table by double-clicking its icon in [Resource View](../windows/resource-view-window.md).  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  If your project doesn't already contain an .rc file, please see [Creating a New Resource Script File](../windows/how-to-create-a-resource-script-file.md).  \n  \n2.  Right-click within the accelerator table and choose **New Accelerator** from the shortcut menu, or click on the empty row entry at the bottom of the table.  \n  \n3.  Select an [ID](id-property.md) from the drop-down list in the ID box or type a new ID in the **ID** box.  \n  \n4.  Type the [Key](../windows/accelerator-key-property.md) you want to use as an accelerator or right-click and choose **Next Key Typed** from the shortcut menu to set a key combination (the **Next Key Typed** command is also available from the **Edit** menu).  \n  \n5.  Change the [Modifier](../windows/accelerator-modifier-property.md) and [Type](../windows/accelerator-type-property.md), if necessary.  \n  \n6.  Press **ENTER**.  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  Make sure all accelerators you define are unique. You can have several key combinations assigned to the same ID with no ill effect, for example, CTRL + P and F8 can both be assigned to ID_PRINT. However, having a key combination assigned to more than one ID will not work well, for example, CTRL + Z assigned to both ID_SPELL_CHECK and ID_THESAURUS.  \n  \n For information on adding resources to managed projects, please see [Resources in Applications](http://msdn.microsoft.com/Library/8ad495d4-2941-40cf-bf64-e82e85825890) in the *.NET Framework Developer's Guide.* For information on manually adding resource files to managed projects, accessing resources, displaying static resources, and assigning resources strings to properties, see [Walkthrough: Using Resources for Localization with ASP.NET](http://msdn.microsoft.com/Library/bb4e5b44-e2b0-48ab-bbe9-609fb33900b6).  \n  \n **Requirements**  \n  \n Win32  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Editing Accelerator Tables](../windows/editing-accelerator-tables.md)   \n [Accelerator Editor](../mfc/accelerator-editor.md)"}
