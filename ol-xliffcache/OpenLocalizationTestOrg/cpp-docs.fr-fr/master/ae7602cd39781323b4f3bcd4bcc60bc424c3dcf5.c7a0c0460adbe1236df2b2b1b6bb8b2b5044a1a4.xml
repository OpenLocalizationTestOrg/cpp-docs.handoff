They do not specify an operation to be performed. Some punctuation symbols are also operators (see [Operators](../c-language/c-operators.md)). The compiler determines their use from context.  \n  \n## Syntax  \n `punctuator`: one of  \n **[ ]   ( )   { }   \\*   ,   :   =   ;   ... #**  \n  \n These characters have special meanings in C. Their uses are described throughout this book. The pound sign (**#**) can occur only in [preprocessing directives](../preprocessor/preprocessor-directives.md).  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Elements of C](../c-language/elements-of-c.md)"}
