window.  \n  \n### To use CTabCtrl directly in a dialog box  \n  \n1.  In the dialog editor, add a Tab Control to your dialog template resource. Specify its control ID.  \n  \n2.  Use the [Add Member Variable Wizard](../ide/adding-a-member-variable-visual-cpp.md) to add a member variable of type [CTabCtrl](../mfc/reference/ctabctrl-class.md) with the Control property. You can use this member to call `CTabCtrl` member functions.  \n  \n3.  Map handler functions in the dialog class for any tab control notification messages you need to handle. For more information, see [Mapping Messages to Functions](../mfc/reference/mapping-messages-to-functions.md).  \n  \n4.  In [OnInitDialog](../mfc/reference/cdialog-class.md#cdialog__oninitdialog), set the styles for the `CTabCtrl`.  \n  \n### To use CTabCtrl in a nondialog window  \n  \n1.  Define the control in the view or window class.  \n  \n2.  Call the control's [Create](../mfc/reference/ctabctrl-class.md#ctabctrl__create) member function, possibly in [OnInitialUpdate](../mfc/reference/cview-class.md#cview__oninitialupdate), possibly as early as the parent window's [OnCreate](../mfc/reference/cwnd-class.md#cwnd__oncreate) handler function (if you're subclassing the control). Set the styles for the control.  \n  \n After the `CTabCtrl` object has been created, you can set or clear the following extended styles:  \n  \n-   **TCS_EX_FLATSEPARATORS** The tab control will draw separators between the tab items. This extended style only affects tab controls that have the **TCS_BUTTONS** and **TCS_FLATBUTTONS** styles. By default, creating the tab control with the **TCS_FLATBUTTONS** style sets this extended style.  \n  \n-   **TCS_EX_REGISTERDROP** The tab control generates **TCN_GETOBJECT** notification messages to request a drop target object when an object is dragged over the tab items in the control.  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  To receive the **TCN_GETOBJECT** notification, you must initialize the OLE libraries with a call to [AfxOleInit](../mfc/reference/ole-initialization.md#afxoleinit).  \n  \n These styles can be retrieved and set, after the control has been created, with respective calls to the [GetExtendedStyle](../mfc/reference/ctabctrl-class.md#ctabctrl__getextendedstyle) and [SetExtendedStyle](../mfc/reference/ctabctrl-class.md#ctabctrl__setextendedstyle) member functions.  \n  \n For instance, set the **TCS_EX_FLATSEPARATORS** style with the following lines of code:  \n  \n [!code-cpp[NVC_MFCControlLadenDialog#33](../mfc/codesnippet/cpp/creating-the-tab-control_1.cpp)]  \n  \n Clear the **TCS_EX_FLATSEPARATORS** style from a `CTabCtrl` object with the following lines of code:  \n  \n [!code-cpp[NVC_MFCControlLadenDialog#34](../mfc/codesnippet/cpp/creating-the-tab-control_2.cpp)]  \n  \n This will remove the separators that appear between the buttons of your `CTabCtrl` object.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Using CTabCtrl](../mfc/using-ctabctrl.md)   \n [Controls](../mfc/controls-mfc.md)\n\n"}
