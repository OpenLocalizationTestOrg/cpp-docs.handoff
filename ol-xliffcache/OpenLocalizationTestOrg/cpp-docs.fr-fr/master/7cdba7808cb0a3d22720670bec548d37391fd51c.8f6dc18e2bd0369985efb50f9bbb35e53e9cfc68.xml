When you create a dialog class with the Add Class Wizard, it writes the following items in the .H and .CPP files you specify:  \n  \n In the .H file:  \n  \n-   A class declaration for the dialog class. The class is derived from [CDialog](../mfc/reference/cdialog-class.md).  \n  \n In the .CPP file:  \n  \n-   A message map for the class.  \n  \n-   A standard constructor for the dialog box.  \n  \n-   An override of the [DoDataExchange](../mfc/reference/cwnd-class.md#cwnd__dodataexchange) member function. Edit this function. It is used for dialog data exchange and validation capabilities as described later in [Dialog data exchange and validation](../mfc/dialog-data-exchange-and-validation.md).  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Creating a Dialog Class with Code Wizards](../mfc/creating-a-dialog-class-with-code-wizards.md)   \n [Life Cycle of a Dialog Box](../mfc/life-cycle-of-a-dialog-box.md)\n\n"}
