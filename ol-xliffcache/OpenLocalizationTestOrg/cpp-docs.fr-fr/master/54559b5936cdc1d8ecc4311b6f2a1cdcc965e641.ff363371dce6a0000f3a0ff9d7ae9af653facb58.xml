[Document/View Creation](../mfc/document-view-creation.md) shows how the framework creates the frame windows associated with documents and views. But for special purposes you can create your own windows — including your own child windows of frame windows or views — in addition to the windows supplied by the framework.  \n  \n## What do you want to know more about  \n  \n-   [Registering window \"classes\"](../mfc/registering-window-classes.md) (as opposed to C++ window objects)  \n  \n-   [General window creation sequence](../mfc/general-window-creation-sequence.md)  \n  \n-   [Destroying window objects](../mfc/destroying-window-objects.md)  \n  \n-   [Working with window objects](../mfc/working-with-window-objects.md)  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Window Objects](../mfc/window-objects.md)\n\n"}
