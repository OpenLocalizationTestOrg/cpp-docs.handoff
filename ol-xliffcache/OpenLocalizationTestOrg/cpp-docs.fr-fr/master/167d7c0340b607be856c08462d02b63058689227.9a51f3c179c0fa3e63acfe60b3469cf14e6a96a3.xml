See [warning](../../preprocessor/warning.md) pragma for information about how to disable this warning.  Also, this warning is only issued once per compiland. Therefore, if there are multiple `#include` directives that specify files in Macintosh format, C4335 will only be issued once.  \n  \n One way to generate files in Macintosh format is by using the **Advanced Save Options** (on the **File** menu) in Visual Studio.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following sample generates C4335.  \n  \n```  \n// C4335 expected  \n#include \"c4335.h\"   // assume both include files are in Macintosh format  \n#include \"c4335_2.h\"  \n```"}
