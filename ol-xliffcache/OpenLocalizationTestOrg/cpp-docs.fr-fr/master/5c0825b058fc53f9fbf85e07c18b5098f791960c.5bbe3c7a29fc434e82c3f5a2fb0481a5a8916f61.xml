The Visual Studio IDE uses [MSBuild](../build/msbuild-visual-cpp.md) to build projects and solutions. On the command line, you can use the C/C++ compiler (cl.exe) and linker (link.exe) to build simple projects. To build more complex projects on the command line, you can use MSBuild or [NMAKE](../build/nmake-reference.md). For an overview about how to use [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../assembler/masm/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] to build projects and solutions, see [Compiling and Building](/visualstudio/ide/compiling-and-building-in-visual-studio).  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Building C++ Projects in Visual Studio](../ide/building-cpp-projects-in-visual-studio.md)  \n Discusses how to use the Visual Studio IDE to build your C/C++ project.  \n  \n [Building on the Command Line](../build/building-on-the-command-line.md)  \n Discusses how to use the C/C++ command-line compiler and build tools that are included in Visual Studio.  \n  \n [Building C/C++ Isolated Applications and Side-by-side Assemblies](../build/building-c-cpp-isolated-applications-and-side-by-side-assemblies.md)  \n Describes the deployment model for Windows Desktop applications, based on the idea of isolated applications and side-by-side assemblies.  \n  \n [C/C++ Building Reference](../build/reference/c-cpp-building-reference.md)  \n Provides links to reference articles about program building in C++, compiler and linker options, and various build tools.  \n  \n [Configuring Programs for 64-Bit](../build/configuring-programs-for-64-bit-visual-cpp.md)  \n Describes how to configure both Visual Studio and the command line to use the 64-bit toolset and how to target 64-bit architectures, and discusses common migration issues when code is moved to 64-bit architectures.  \n  \n [Configuring Programs for ARM Processors](../build/configuring-programs-for-arm-processors-visual-cpp.md)  \n Describes the conventions used by ARM processors, and discusses common migration issues when code is moved to ARM architectures.  \n  \n [Configuring Programs for Windows XP](../build/configuring-programs-for-windows-xp.md)  \n Describes how to set the Platform Toolset to target Windows XP development.  \n  \n## Related Sections  \n [NIB: Samples Included in Visual C++](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/c9ec56b3-2bbd-49b4-8a4c-9ed4b78b7a84)  \n Provides links to sample code that shows the capabilities of Visual C++ and the libraries and technologies it supports.  \n  \n [Compiling and Building](/visualstudio/ide/compiling-and-building-in-visual-studio)  \n Describes the Visual Studio build system and tools."}
