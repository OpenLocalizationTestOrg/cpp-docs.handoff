A sizing grip is similar to a sizing border; it is a rectangular area that the user can click and drag to resize the parent window.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  If you combine the `CCS_TOP` and **SBARS_SIZEGRIP** styles, the resulting sizing grip is not functional even though the system draws it in the status window.  \n  \n The window procedure for the status window automatically sets the initial size and position of the control window. The width is the same as that of the parent window's client area. The height is based on the metrics of the font that is currently selected into the status window's device context and on the width of the window's borders.  \n  \n The window procedure automatically adjusts the size of the status window whenever it receives a `WM_SIZE` message. Typically, when the size of the parent window changes, the parent sends a `WM_SIZE` message to the status window.  \n  \n You can set the minimum height of a status window's drawing area by calling [SetMinHeight](../mfc/reference/cstatusbarctrl-class.md#cstatusbarctrl__setminheight), specifying the minimum height in pixels. The drawing area does not include the window's borders.  \n  \n You retrieve the widths of the borders of a status window by calling [GetBorders](../mfc/reference/cstatusbarctrl-class.md#cstatusbarctrl__getborders). This member function includes the pointer to a three-element array that receives the width of the horizontal border, the vertical border, and the border between rectangles.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Using CStatusBarCtrl](../mfc/using-cstatusbarctrl.md)   \n [Controls](../mfc/controls-mfc.md)\n\n"}
