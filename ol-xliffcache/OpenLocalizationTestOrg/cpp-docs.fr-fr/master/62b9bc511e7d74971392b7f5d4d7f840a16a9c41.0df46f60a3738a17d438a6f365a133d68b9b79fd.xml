Create two `COleDateTime` objects.  \n  \n2.  Set one of the `COleDateTime` objects to the current time.  \n  \n3.  Perform some time-consuming task.  \n  \n4.  Set the other `COleDateTime` object to the current time.  \n  \n5.  Take the difference between the two times.  \n  \n     [!code-cpp[NVC_ATLMFC_Utilities#178](../atl-mfc-shared/codesnippet/cpp/elapsed-time-automation-classes_1.cpp)]  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Date and Time: Automation Support](../atl-mfc-shared/date-and-time-automation-support.md)\n\n"}
