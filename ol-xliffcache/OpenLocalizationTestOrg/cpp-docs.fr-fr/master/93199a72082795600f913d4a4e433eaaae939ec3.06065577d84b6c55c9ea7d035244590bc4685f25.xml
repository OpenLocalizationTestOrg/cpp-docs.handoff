__interface)](../cpp/interface.md) C++ keyword.  \n  \n|Attribute|Description|  \n|---------------|-----------------|  \n|[async_uuid](../windows/async-uuid.md)|Specifies the UUID that directs the MIDL compiler to define both synchronous and asynchronous versions of a COM interface.|  \n|[custom](../windows/custom-cpp.md)|Lets you define your own attributes.|  \n|[dispinterface](../windows/dispinterface.md)|Places an interface in the .idl file as a dispatch interface.|  \n|[dual](../windows/dual.md)|Places an interface in the .idl file as a dual interface.|  \n|[export](../windows/export.md)|Causes a data structure to be placed in the .idl file.|  \n|[helpcontext](../windows/helpcontext.md)|Specifies a context ID that lets the user view information about this element in the Help file.|  \n|[helpfile](../windows/helpfile.md)|Sets the name of the Help file for a type library.|  \n|[helpstring](../windows/helpstring.md)|Specifies a character string that is used to describe the element to which it applies.|  \n|[helpstringcontext](../windows/helpstringcontext.md)|Specifies the ID of a help topic in an .hlp or .chm file.|  \n|[helpstringdll](../windows/helpstringdll.md)|Specifies the name of the DLL to use to perform document string lookup (localization).|  \n|[hidden](../windows/hidden.md)|Indicates that the item exists but should not be displayed in a user-oriented browser.|  \n|[library_block](../windows/library-block.md)|Places a construct inside the .idl file's library block.|  \n|[local](../windows/local-cpp.md)|Allows you to use the MIDL compiler as a header generator when used in the interface header. When used in an individual function, designates a local procedure for which no stubs are generated.|  \n|[nonextensible](../windows/nonextensible.md)|Specifies that the `IDispatch` implementation includes only the properties and methods listed in the interface description and cannot be extended with additional members at run time. This attribute is only valid on a [dual](../windows/dual.md) interface.|  \n|[odl](../windows/odl.md)|Identifies an interface as an Object Description Language (ODL) interface.|  \n|[object](../windows/object-cpp.md)|Identifies a custom interface.|  \n|[oleautomation](../windows/oleautomation.md)|Indicates that an interface is compatible with Automation.|  \n|[pointer_default](../windows/pointer-default.md)|Specifies the default pointer attribute for all pointers except top-level pointers that appear in parameter lists.|  \n|[ptr](../windows/ptr.md)|Designates a pointer as a full pointer.|  \n|[restricted](../windows/restricted.md)|Designates which members of the library cannot be called arbitrarily.|  \n|[uuid](../windows/uuid-cpp-attributes.md)|Provides the unique ID for the library|  \n  \n You must observe these rules for defining an interface:  \n  \n-   Default calling convention is [__stdcall](../cpp/stdcall.md).  \n  \n-   A GUID is supplied for you if you do not supply one.  \n  \n-   No overloaded methods are allowed.  \n  \n When not specifying the [uuid](../windows/uuid-cpp-attributes.md) attribute and using the same interface name in different attribute projects, the same GUID is generated.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Attributes by Usage](../windows/attributes-by-usage.md)"}
