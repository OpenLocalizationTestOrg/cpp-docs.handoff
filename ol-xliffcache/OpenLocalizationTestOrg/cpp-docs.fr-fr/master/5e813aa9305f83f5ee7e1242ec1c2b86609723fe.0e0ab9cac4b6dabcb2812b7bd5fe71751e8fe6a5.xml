The documents managed by a container application must be able to store and display OLE compound document components as well as data created by the application itself. A container application must also allow users to insert new items or edit existing items.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Implement a Container](../mfc/containers-implementing-a-container.md)  \n  \n [Container Client Items](../mfc/containers-client-items.md)  \n  \n [Use Compound Files](../mfc/containers-compound-files.md)  \n  \n [Container User-Interface Issues](../mfc/containers-user-interface-issues.md)  \n  \n [Advanced Features of Containers](../mfc/containers-advanced-features.md)  \n  \n## See Also  \n [OLE](../mfc/ole-in-mfc.md)   \n [Servers](../mfc/servers.md)   \n [Activation](../mfc/activation-cpp.md)   \n [Menus and Resources (OLE)](../mfc/menus-and-resources-ole.md)\n\n"}
