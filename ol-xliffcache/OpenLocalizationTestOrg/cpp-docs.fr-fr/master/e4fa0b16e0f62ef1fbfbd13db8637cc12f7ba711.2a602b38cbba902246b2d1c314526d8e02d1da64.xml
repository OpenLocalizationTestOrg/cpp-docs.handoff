These directives put **NOP** (no operation) instructions in the assembly code as needed to align labels to specific boundaries. This makes instruction-fetch operations more efficient for some processors.  \n  \n **END Microsoft Specific**  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Using Assembly Language in __asm Blocks](../../assembler/inline/using-assembly-language-in-asm-blocks.md)"}
