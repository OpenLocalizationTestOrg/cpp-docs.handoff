This lock is biased towards writers and can starve readers under a continuous load of writers.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"ctor\"></a>  reader_writer_lock::reader_writer_lock Constructor  \n Constructs a new `reader_writer_lock` object.  \n  \n```\nreader_writer_lock();\n```  \n  \n##  <a name=\"dtor\"></a>  reader_writer_lock::~reader_writer_lock Destructor  \n Destroys the `reader_writer_lock` object.  \n  \n```\n~reader_writer_lock();\n```  \n  \n### Remarks  \n It is expected that the lock is no longer held when the destructor runs. Allowing the reader writer lock to destruct with the lock still held results in undefined behavior.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"scoped_lock_class\"></a>  reader_writer_lock::scoped_lock Class  \n An exception safe RAII wrapper that can be used to acquire `reader_writer_lock` lock objects as a writer.  \n  \n```\nclass scoped_lock;\n``` \n## <a name=\"scoped_lock_ctor\"></a>  reader_writer_lock::scoped_lock::scoped_lock Constructor\nConstructs a `scoped_lock` object and acquires the `reader_writer_lock` object passed in the `_Reader_writer_lock` parameter as a writer. If the lock is held by another thread, this call will block.  \n  \n  \n```\nexplicit _CRTIMP scoped_lock(reader_writer_lock& _Reader_writer_lock);\n```  \n  \n#### Parameters  \n `_Reader_writer_lock`  \n The `reader_writer_lock` object to acquire as a writer.  \n  \n## <a name=\"scoped_lock_dtor\"></a>  reader_writer_lock::scoped_lock::~scoped_lock Destructor\n\nDestroys a `reader_writer_lock` object and releases the lock supplied in its constructor.   \n\n```\n~scoped_lock();\n```  \n  \n##  <a name=\"scoped_lock_read_class\"></a>  reader_writer_lock::scoped_lock_read Class  \n An exception safe RAII wrapper that can be used to acquire `reader_writer_lock` lock objects as a reader.  \n  \n```\nclass scoped_lock_read;\n```  \n  \n##  <a name=\"try_lock\"></a>  reader_writer_lock::try_lock Method  \n Attempts to acquire the reader-writer lock as a writer without blocking.  \n\n## <a name=\"scoped_lock_read_ctor\"></a>  reader_writer_lock::scoped_lock_read::scoped_lock_read Constructor\nConstructs a `scoped_lock_read` object and acquires the `reader_writer_lock` object passed in the `_Reader_writer_lock` parameter as a reader. If the lock is held by another thread as a writer or there are pending writers, this call will block.  \n  \n```\nexplicit _CRTIMP scoped_lock_read(reader_writer_lock& _Reader_writer_lock);\n```  \n  \n#### Parameters  \n `_Reader_writer_lock`  \n The `reader_writer_lock` object to acquire as a reader.  \n  \n## <a name=\"scoped_lock_read_dtor\">  reader_writer_lock::scoped_lock_read::~scoped_lock_read Destructor\nDestroys a `scoped_lock_read` object and releases the lock supplied in its constructor.  \n\n```\n~scoped_lock_read();\n```  \n  \n## <a name=\"try_lock\"></a> reader_writer_lock::try_lock Method\n```\nbool try_lock();\n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n If the lock was acquired, the value `true`; otherwise, the value `false`.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"try_lock_read\"></a>  reader_writer_lock::try_lock_read Method  \n Attempts to acquire the reader-writer lock as a reader without blocking.  \n  \n```\nbool try_lock_read();\n```  \n  \n### Return Value  \n If the lock was acquired, the value `true`; otherwise, the value `false`.  \n  \n##  <a name=\"unlock\"></a>  reader_writer_lock::unlock Method  \n Unlocks the reader-writer lock based on who locked it, reader or writer.  \n  \n```\nvoid unlock();\n```  \n  \n### Remarks  \n If there are writers waiting on the lock, the release of the lock will always go to the next writer in FIFO order. This lock is biased towards writers and can starve readers under a continuous load of writers.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [concurrency Namespace](concurrency-namespace.md)   \n [critical_section Class](critical-section-class.md)\n"}
