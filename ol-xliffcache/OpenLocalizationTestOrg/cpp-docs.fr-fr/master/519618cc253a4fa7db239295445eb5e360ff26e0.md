# Filenames
**ANSI 4.9.3** The rules for composing valid file names  
  
 A file specification can include an optional drive letter (always followed by a colon), a series of optional directory names (separated by backslashes), and a filename.  
  
 For more information, see [Naming a File](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa365247) for more information.
