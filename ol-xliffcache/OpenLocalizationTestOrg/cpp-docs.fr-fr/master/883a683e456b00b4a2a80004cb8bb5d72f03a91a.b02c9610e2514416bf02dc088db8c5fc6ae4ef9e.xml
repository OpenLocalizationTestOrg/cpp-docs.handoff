system_clock;  \n```  \n  \n## Remarks  \n A *clock type* is used to obtain the current time as UTC. The type embodies an instantiation of [duration](../standard-library/duration-class.md) and the class template [time_point](../standard-library/time-point-class.md), and defines a static member function `now()` that returns the time.  \n  \n A clock is *monotonic* if the value that is returned by a first call to `now()` is always less than or equal to the value that is returned by a subsequent call to `now()`.  \n  \n A clock is *steady* if it is *monotonic* and if the time between clock ticks is constant.  \n  \n In this implementation, a `system_clock` is synonymous with a `high_resolution_clock`.  \n  \n## Members  \n  \n### Public Typedefs  \n  \n|Name|Description|  \n|----------|-----------------|  \n|`system_clock::duration`|A synonym for `duration<rep, period>`.|  \n|`system_clock::period`|A synonym for the type that is used to represent the tick period in the contained instantiation of `duration`.|  \n|`system_clock::rep`|A synonym for the type that is used to represent the number of clock ticks in the contained instantiation of `duration`.|  \n|`system_clock::time_point`|A synonym for `time_point<Clock, duration>`, where `Clock` is a synonym for either the clock type itself or another clock type that is based on the same epoch and has the same nested `duration` type.|  \n  \n### Public Methods  \n  \n|Name|Description|  \n|----------|-----------------|  \n|[system_clock::from_time_t Method](#system_clock__from_time_t_method)|Static.
