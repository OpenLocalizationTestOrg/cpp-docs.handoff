If <xref:System.Environment.UserInteractive%2A> is false, then the code is running as a service process or from inside a Web application, in which case you should not attempt to interact with the user.  \n  \n## Example  \n  \n```  \n// user_interactive.cpp  \n// compile with: /clr  \nusing namespace System;  \n  \nint main()   \n{  \n   if ( Environment::UserInteractive )  \n      Console::WriteLine(\"User interactive\");  \n   else  \n      Console::WriteLine(\"Noninteractive\");  \n   return 0;  \n}  \n```  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Windows Operations (C++/CLI)](../dotnet/windows-operations-cpp-cli.md)   \n [.NET Programming with C++/CLI (Visual C++)](../dotnet/dotnet-programming-with-cpp-cli-visual-cpp.md)"}
