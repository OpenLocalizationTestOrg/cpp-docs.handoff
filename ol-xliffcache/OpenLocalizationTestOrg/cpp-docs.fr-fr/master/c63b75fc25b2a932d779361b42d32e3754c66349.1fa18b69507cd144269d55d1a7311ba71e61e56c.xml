principles that emphasize simple user interfaces that are centered around content that automatically adjusts for different screen sizes on different devices. You create the UI in XAML markup, and the code-behind in native C++. You can also create components (DLLs) that can be consumed by UWP apps that are written in other languages. The API surface for UWP apps is the [!INCLUDE[wrt](../atl/reference/includes/wrt_md.md)], which is a well-factored library that provides a wide variety of operating system services.  \n\n> [!TIP]  \n> For Windows 10, you can use the Desktop App Converter to package your existing desktop application for deployment through the Windows Store.
