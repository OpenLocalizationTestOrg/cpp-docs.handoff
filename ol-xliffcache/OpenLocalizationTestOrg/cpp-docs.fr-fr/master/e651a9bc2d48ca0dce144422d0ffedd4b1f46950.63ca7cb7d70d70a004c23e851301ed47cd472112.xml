Document Classes\nDocument class objects, created by document-template objects, manage the application's data. You will derive a class for your documents from one of these classes.  \n  \n Document class objects interact with view objects. View objects represent the client area of a window, display a document's data, and allow users to interact with it. Documents and views are created by a document-template object.  \n  \n [CDocument](../mfc/reference/cdocument-class.md)  \n The base class for application-specific documents. Derive your document class or classes from **CDocument**.  \n  \n [COleDocument](../mfc/reference/coledocument-class.md)  \n Used for compound document implementation, as well as basic container support. Serves as a container for classes derived from [CDocItem](../mfc/reference/cdocitem-class.md). This class can be used as the base class for container documents and is the base class for `COleServerDoc`.  \n  \n [COleLinkingDoc](../mfc/reference/colelinkingdoc-class.md)  \n A class derived from `COleDocument` that provides the infrastructure for linking. You should derive the document classes for your container applications from this class instead of from `COleDocument` if you want them to support links to embedded objects.  \n  \n [CRichEditDoc](../mfc/reference/cricheditdoc-class.md)  \n Maintains the list of OLE client items that are in the rich edit control. Used with [CRichEditView](../mfc/reference/cricheditview-class.md) and [CRichEditCntrItem](../mfc/reference/cricheditcntritem-class.md).  \n  \n [COleServerDoc](../mfc/reference/coleserverdoc-class.md)  \n Used as the base class for server-application document classes. `COleServerDoc` objects provide the bulk of server support through interactions with [COleServerItem](../mfc/reference/coleserveritem-class.md) objects. Visual editing capability is provided using the class library's document/view architecture.  \n  \n [CHtmlEditDoc](../mfc/reference/chtmleditdoc-class.md)  \n Provides, with [CHtmlEditView](../mfc/reference/chtmleditview-class.md), the functionality of the WebBrowser HTML editing platform within the context of the MFC document-view architecture.  \n  \n## Related Classes  \n Document class objects can be persistent — in other words, they can write their state to a storage medium and read it back. MFC provides the `CArchive` class to facilitate transferring the document's data to a storage medium.  \n  \n [CArchive](../mfc/reference/carchive-class.md)  \n Cooperates with a [CFile](../mfc/reference/cfile-class.md) object to implement persistent storage for objects through serialization (see [CObject::Serialize](../mfc/reference/cobject-class.md#cobject__serialize)).  \n  \n Documents can also contain OLE objects. `CDocItem` is the base class of the server and client items.  \n  \n [CDocItem](../mfc/reference/cdocitem-class.md)  \n Abstract base class of [COleClientItem](../mfc/reference/coleclientitem-class.md) and [COleServerItem](../mfc/reference/coleserveritem-class.md). Objects of classes derived from `CDocItem` represent parts of documents.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Class Overview](../mfc/class-library-overview.md)\n\n"}
