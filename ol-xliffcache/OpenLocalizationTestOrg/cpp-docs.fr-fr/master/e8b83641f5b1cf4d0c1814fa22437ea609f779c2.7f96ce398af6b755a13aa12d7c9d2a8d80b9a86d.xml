The derived classes supplied by the class library represent various kinds of windows.  \n  \n [CWnd](../mfc/reference/cwnd-class.md)  \n The base class for all windows. You can use one of the classes derived from `CWnd` or derive your own classes directly from it.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Class Overview](../mfc/class-library-overview.md)\n\n"}
