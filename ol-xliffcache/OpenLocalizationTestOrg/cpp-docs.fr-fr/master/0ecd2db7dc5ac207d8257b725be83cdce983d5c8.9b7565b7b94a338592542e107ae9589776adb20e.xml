The compiler will now detect these multiple definitions  \n  \n-   __int32 and int were treated as separate types. The compiler now treats \\__int32 as a synonym for int. This means that the compiler will detect multiple definitions if a function is overloaded on both \\__int32 and int and give an error.  \n  \n The following sample generates C2084:  \n  \n```  \n// C2084.cpp  \nvoid Func(int);  \nvoid Func(int) {}   // define function  \nvoid Func(int) {}   // C2084 second definition  \n```  \n  \n Possible resolution:  \n  \n```  \n// C2084b.cpp  \n// compile with: /c  \nvoid Func(int);  \nvoid Func(int) {}  \n```"}
