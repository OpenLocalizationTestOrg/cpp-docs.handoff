When the compiler (back end) detects unreachable code, it will generate C4702, a level 4 warning.  \n  \n For code that is valid in both the Visual Studio .NET 2003 and Visual Studio .NET versions of Visual C++, remove the unreachable code or assure that all source code is reachable by some flow of execution.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following sample generates C4702.  \n  \n```  \n// C4702.cpp  \n// compile with: /W4  \n#include <stdio.h>  \n  \nint main() {  \n   return 1;  \n   printf_s(\"I won't print.\\n\");   // C4702 unreachable  \n}  \n```  \n  \n## Example  \n When compiling with **/GX**, **/EHc**, **/EHsc**, or **/EHac** and using extern C functions, code can become unreachable because extern C functions are assumed to not throw, thus the catch block isn't reachable.  If you feel that this warning is not valid because a function can throw, compile with **/EHa** or **/EHs**, depending on the exception thrown.  \n  \n For more information, see [/EH (Exception Handling Model)](../../build/reference/eh-exception-handling-model.md) for more information.  \n  \n The following sample generates C4702.  \n  \n```  \n// C4702b.cpp  \n// compile with: /W4 /EHsc  \n#include <iostream>  \n  \nusing namespace std;  \nextern \"C\" __declspec(dllexport) void Function2(){}  \n  \nint main() {  \n   try {  \n      Function2();  \n   }  \n   catch (...) {  \n      cout << \"Exp: Function2!\" << endl;   // C4702  \n   }  \n}  \n```"}
