More secure versions of these functions are available; see [memcpy_s, wmemcpy_s](../../c-runtime-library/reference/memcpy-s-wmemcpy-s.md).  \n  \n## Syntax  \n  \n```  \nvoid *memcpy(  \n   void *dest,  \n   const void *src,  \n   size_t count   \n);  \nwchar_t *wmemcpy(  \n   wchar_t *dest,  \n   const wchar_t *src,  \n   size_t count  \n);  \n```  \n  \n#### Parameters  \n `dest`  \n New buffer.  \n  \n `src`  \n Buffer to copy from.  \n  \n `count`  \n Number of characters to copy.  \n  \n## Return Value  \n The value of `dest`.  \n  \n## Remarks  \n `memcpy` copies `count` bytes from `src` to `dest`; `wmemcpy` copies `count` wide characters (two bytes). If the source and destination overlap, the behavior of `memcpy` is undefined. Use `memmove` to handle overlapping regions.  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  Make sure that the destination buffer is the same size or larger than the source buffer.
