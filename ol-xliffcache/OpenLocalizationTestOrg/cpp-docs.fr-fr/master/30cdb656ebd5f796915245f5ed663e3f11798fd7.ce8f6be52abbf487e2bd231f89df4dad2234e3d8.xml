ATL projects should use the **New Windows Messages and Event Handlers** dialog box.  \n  \n### To define a member variable for a (non-button) dialog box control  \n  \n1.  In the [Dialog editor](../mfc/dialog-editor.md), select a control.  \n  \n2.  While pressing the **CTRL** key, double-click the dialog box control.  \n  \n     The [Add Member Variable wizard](../ide/add-member-variable-wizard.md) appears.  \n  \n3.  Type the appropriate information in the **Add Member Variable** wizard. For more information, see [Dialog Data Exchange](../mfc/dialog-data-exchange.md).  \n  \n4.  Click **OK** to return to the Dialog editor.  \n  \n    > [!TIP]\n    >  To jump from any dialog box control to its existing handler, double-click the control.  \n  \n For information on adding resources to managed projects, please see [Resources in Applications](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/8ad495d4-2941-40cf-bf64-e82e85825890) in the *.NET Framework Developer's Guide.* For information on manually adding resource files to managed projects, accessing resources, displaying static resources, and assigning resources strings to properties, see [Walkthrough: Using Resources for Localization with ASP.NET](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/bb4e5b44-e2b0-48ab-bbe9-609fb33900b6).  \n  \n You can also use the **Member Variables** tab in **MFC Class Wizard** to add new member variables for a specified class, and view those that have already been defined.  \n  \n Requirements  \n  \n MFC  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Mapping Messages to Functions](../mfc/reference/mapping-messages-to-functions.md)   \n [Adding Functionality with Code Wizards](../ide/adding-functionality-with-code-wizards-cpp.md)   \n [MFC Class Wizard](../mfc/reference/mfc-class-wizard.md)   \n [Adding a Class](../ide/adding-a-class-visual-cpp.md)   \n [Adding a Member Function](../ide/adding-a-member-function-visual-cpp.md)   \n [Adding a Member Variable](../ide/adding-a-member-variable-visual-cpp.md)   \n [Overriding a Virtual Function](../ide/overriding-a-virtual-function-visual-cpp.md)   \n [MFC Message Handler](../mfc/reference/adding-an-mfc-message-handler.md)\n\n"}
