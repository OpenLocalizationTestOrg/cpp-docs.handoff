The constructor creates the object and an initialization function initializes it.  \n  \n Two-stage construction is always safer. In one-stage construction, the constructor could throw an exception if you provide incorrect arguments or memory allocation fails. That problem is avoided by two-stage construction, although you do have to check for failure. In either case, destroying the object is the same process.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  These techniques apply to creating any objects, not just graphic objects.  \n  \n## Example of Both Construction Techniques  \n The following brief example shows both methods of constructing a pen object:  \n  \n [!code-cpp[NVC_MFCDocViewSDI#6](../mfc/codesnippet/cpp/one-stage-and-two-stage-construction-of-objects_1.cpp)]  \n  \n### What do you want to know more about  \n  \n-   [Graphic objects](../mfc/graphic-objects.md)  \n  \n-   [Selecting a graphic object into a device context](../mfc/selecting-a-graphic-object-into-a-device-context.md)  \n  \n-   [Device contexts](../mfc/device-contexts.md)  \n  \n-   [Drawing in a View](../mfc/drawing-in-a-view.md)  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Graphic Objects](../mfc/graphic-objects.md)\n\n"}
