You specify an AppID by indicating its value in the AppID named value under the object's CLSID.  \n  \n By default, an ATL-generated service uses its CLSID as the GUID for its AppID. Under `HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\AppID`, you can specify DCOM-specific entries. Initially, two entries exist:  \n  \n-   `LocalService`, with a value equal to the name of the service. If this value exists, it is used instead of the `LocalServer32` key under the CLSID.  \n  \n-   `ServiceParameters`, with a value equal to `–Service`. This value specifies parameters that will be passed to the service when it is started. Note that these parameters are passed to the service's `ServiceMain` function, not `WinMain`.  \n  \n Any DCOM service also needs to create another key under `HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\AppID`. This key is equal to the name of the EXE and acts as a cross-reference, as it contains an AppID value pointing back to the AppID entries.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Services](../atl/atl-services.md)\n\n"}
