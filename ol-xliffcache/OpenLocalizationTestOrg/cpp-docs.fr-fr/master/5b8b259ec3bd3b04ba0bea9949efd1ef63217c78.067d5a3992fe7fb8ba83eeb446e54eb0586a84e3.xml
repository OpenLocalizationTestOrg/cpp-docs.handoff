Brushes are used for filling interiors of objects being drawn.  \n  \n [CPen](../mfc/reference/cpen-class.md)  \n Encapsulates a GDI pen that can be selected as the current pen in a device context. Pens are used for drawing the border lines of objects.  \n  \n [CFont](../mfc/reference/cfont-class.md)  \n Encapsulates a GDI font that can be selected as the current font in a device context.  \n  \n [CBitmap](../mfc/reference/cbitmap-class.md)  \n Encapsulates a GDI bitmap, providing an interface for manipulating bitmaps.  \n  \n [CPalette](../mfc/reference/cpalette-class.md)  \n Encapsulates a GDI color palette for use as an interface between the application and a color output device such as a display.  \n  \n [CRectTracker](../mfc/reference/crecttracker-class.md)  \n Displays and handles the user interface for resizing and moving rectangular objects.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Class Overview](../mfc/class-library-overview.md)\n\n"}
