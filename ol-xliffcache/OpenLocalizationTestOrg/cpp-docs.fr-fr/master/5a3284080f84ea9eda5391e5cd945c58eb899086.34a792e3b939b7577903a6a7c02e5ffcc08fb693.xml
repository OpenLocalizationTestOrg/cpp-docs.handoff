Your tasks in writing your view class are to:  \n  \n-   Write your view class's [OnDraw](../mfc/reference/cview-class.md#cview__ondraw) member function, which renders the document's data.  \n  \n-   Connect appropriate Windows messages and user-interface objects such as menu items to message-handler member functions in the view class.  \n  \n-   Implement those handlers to interpret user input.  \n  \n In addition, you may need to override other `CView` member functions in your derived view class. In particular, you may want to override [OnInitialUpdate](../mfc/reference/cview-class.md#cview__oninitialupdate) to perform special initialization for the view and [OnUpdate](../mfc/reference/cview-class.md#cview__onupdate) to do any special processing needed just before the view redraws itself. For multipage documents, you also must override [OnPreparePrinting](../mfc/reference/cview-class.md#cview__onprepareprinting) to initialize the Print dialog box with the number of pages to print and other information. For more information on overriding `CView` member functions, see class [CView](../mfc/reference/cview-class.md) in the *MFC Reference*.  \n  \n## What do you want to know more about  \n  \n-   [Derived view classes available in MFC](../mfc/derived-view-classes-available-in-mfc.md)  \n  \n-   [Drawing in a view](../mfc/drawing-in-a-view.md)  \n  \n-   [Interpreting user input through a view](../mfc/interpreting-user-input-through-a-view.md)  \n  \n-   [The role of the view in printing](../mfc/role-of-the-view-in-printing.md)  \n  \n-   [Scrolling and scaling views](../mfc/scrolling-and-scaling-views.md)  \n  \n-   [Initializing and cleaning up documents and views](../mfc/initializing-and-cleaning-up-documents-and-views.md)  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Document/View Architecture](../mfc/document-view-architecture.md)   \n [CFormView Class](../mfc/reference/cformview-class.md)   \n [Record Views  (MFC Data Access)](../data/record-views-mfc-data-access.md)   \n [Bypassing the Serialization Mechanism](../mfc/bypassing-the-serialization-mechanism.md)\n\n"}
