Each host window is designed to hold exactly one control at a time (this allows for a simple mechanism for handling message reflection and per-control ambient properties). However, if you need the user to see multiple controls in a single window, it's a simple matter to create multiple host windows as children of that window.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Control Containment FAQ](../atl/atl-control-containment-faq.md)\n\n"}
