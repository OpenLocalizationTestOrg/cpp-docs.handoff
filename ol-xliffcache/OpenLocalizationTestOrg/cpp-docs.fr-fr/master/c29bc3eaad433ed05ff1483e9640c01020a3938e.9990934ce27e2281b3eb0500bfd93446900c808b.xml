Select a control in the [Toolbox Window](/visualstudio/ide/reference/toolbox).  \n  \n2.  Place your cursor (which appears as cross hairs) where you want the upper-left corner of the new control to be on your dialog box.  \n  \n3.  Click and hold down the mouse button to anchor the upper-left corner of your control on the dialog box, then drag the cursor to the right and down until the control is the size you want.  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  You can actually anchor any of the four corners of the control you're drawing. This procedure used the upper-left corner as an example.  \n  \n4.  Release the mouse button. The control settles onto the dialog box in the size you specified.  \n  \n    > [!TIP]\n    >  You can resize the control after dropping it onto the dialog box by moving the sizing handles on the border of the control.
