This warning will occur in the obvious situation:  \n  \n```  \n// C4101a.cpp  \n// compile with: /W3  \nint main() {  \nint i;   // C4101  \n}  \n```  \n  \n However, this warning will also occur when calling a **static** member function through an instance of the class:  \n  \n```  \n// C4101b.cpp  \n// compile with:  /W3  \nstruct S {  \n   static int func()  \n   {  \n      return 1;  \n   }  \n};  \n  \nint main() {  \n   S si;   // C4101, si is never used  \n   int y = si.func();  \n   return y;  \n}  \n```  \n  \n In this situation, the compiler uses information about `si` to access the **static** function, but the instance of the class is not needed to call the **static** function; hence the warning. To resolve this warning, you could:  \n  \n-   Add a constructor, in which the compiler would use the instance of `si` in the call to `func`.  \n  \n-   Remove the **static** keyword from the definition of `func`.  \n  \n-   Call the **static** function explicitly: `int y = S::func();`."}
