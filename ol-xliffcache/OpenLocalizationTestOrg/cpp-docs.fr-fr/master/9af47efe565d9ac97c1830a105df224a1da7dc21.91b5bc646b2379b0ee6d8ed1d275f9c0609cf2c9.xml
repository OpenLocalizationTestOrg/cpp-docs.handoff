Code that is generated by using **/favor:ATOM** may also produce Intel SSSE3, SSE3, SSE2, and SSE instructions for Intel processors.  \n  \n **/favor:AMD64**  \n (x64 only) optimizes the generated code for the AMD Opteron, and Athlon processors that support 64-bit extensions. The optimized code can run on all x64 compatible platforms. Code that is generated by using **/favor:AMD64** might cause worse performance on Intel processors that support Intel64.  \n  \n **/favor:INTEL64**  \n (x64 only) optimizes the generated code for Intel processors that support Intel64, which typically yields better performance for that platform. The resulting code can run on any x64 platform.
