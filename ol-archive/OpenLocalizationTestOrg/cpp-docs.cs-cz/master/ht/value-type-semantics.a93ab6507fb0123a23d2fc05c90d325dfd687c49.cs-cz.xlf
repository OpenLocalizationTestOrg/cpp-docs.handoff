          <source>The primary motive behind this design is pedagogical: underlying mechanism needs to be visible to the programmer so that she will understand the 'cost' of not providing an instance within her value type.</source>

        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="116" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>The reason for preferring the implicit boxing is that while there is usually just one class designer, there are an unlimited number of users, none of whom would have the freedom to modify <ph id="ph1">`V`</ph> to eliminate the possibly onerous explicit box.</source>

          <source>The criteria by which to determine whether or not to provide an overriding instance of <ph id="ph1">`ToString`</ph> within a value class should be the frequency and location of its uses.</source>

          <source>Another difference with a value type between Managed Extensions and the new syntax is the removal of support for a default constructor.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="123" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>This is because there are occasions during execution in which the CLR can create an instance of the value type without invoking the associated default constructor.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="124" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>That is, the attempt under Managed Extensions to support a default constructor within a value type could not in practice be guaranteed.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="125" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Given that absence of guarantee, it was felt to be better to drop the support altogether rather than have it be non-deterministic in its application.</source>

        <trans-unit id="126" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>This is not as bad as it might initially seem.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="127" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>This is because each object of a value type is zeroed out automatically (that is, each type is initialized to its default value).</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="128" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>As a result, the members of a local instance are never undefined.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="129" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>In this sense, the loss of the ability to define a trivial default constructor is really not a loss at all â€“ and in fact is more efficient when performed by the CLR.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="130" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>The problem is when a user of Managed Extensions defines a non-trivial default constructor.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="131" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>This has no mapping to the new syntax.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="132" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>The code within the constructor will need to be migrated into a named initialization method that would then need to be explicitly invoked by the user.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="133" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>The declaration of a value type object within the new syntax is otherwise unchanged.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="134" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>The down side of this is that value types are not satisfactory for the wrapping of native types for the following reasons:</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="135" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>There is no support for a destructor within a value type.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="136" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>That is, there is no way to automate a set of actions triggered by the end of an object's lifetime.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="137" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>A native class can be contained only within a managed type as a pointer which is then allocated on the native heap.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="138" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>We would like to wrap a small native class in a value type rather than a reference type to avoid a double heap allocation: the native heap to hold the native type, and the CLR heap to hold the managed wrapper.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="139" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Wrapping a native class within a value type allows you to avoid the managed heap, but provides no way to automate the reclamation of the native heap memory.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="140" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Reference types are the only practicable managed type within which to wrap non-trivial native classes.</source>

          <source>So, a <ph id="ph1">`V*`</ph> can address a location within a local block (and therefore can be dangling), at global scope, within the native heap (for example, if the object it addresses has already been deleted), within the CLR heap (and therefore will be tracked if it should be relocated during garbage collection), and within the interior of a reference object on the CLR heap (an interior pointer, as this is called, is also transparently tracked).</source>

          <source>In Managed Extensions, there is no way to separate out the native aspects of a <ph id="ph1">`V*`</ph>; that is, it is treated at its inclusive, which handles the possibility of it addressing an object or subobject on the managed heap.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="146" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>In the new syntax, a value type pointer is factored into two types: <ph id="ph1">`V*`</ph>, which is limited to non-CLR heap locations, and the interior pointer, <ph id="ph2">`interior_ptr&lt;V&gt;`</ph>, which allows for but does not require an address within the managed heap.</source>
